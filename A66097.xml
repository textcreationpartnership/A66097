            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THough it be a fault over common for men to pick a quarrel with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times for being worſe than thoſe that went before, reproved by the Wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſ. 7. 10.</hi> When men have more reaſon to fall out with themſelves for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the times ſo bad; yet it is certain that the al wiſe Providence of an holy God brings many changes over the World, and his People in it. There are times when the Churches have reſt, are edified, and multiplied: and there are times when iniquity abounds, and Perſecution ariſeth, and Gods People are ſcattered. What theſe times are into which we are now fallen is obvious to him that will not ſhut his eyes It is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the true fearers of God, that he hath provided them conſolations ſtrong enough to hold up their heads above water when the waves riſe
<pb facs="tcp:100127:3"/> higheſt, and the raging billows make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt noiſe. When the Earth and all in it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us no comfort, then heaven can. And as it is our wiſdom to be laying up treaſures beyond Death and the Grave, out of the reach of time and change, ſo it is our intereſt to be ſtrengthening our faith, and corroborating our hope by ſuch things as all the malice of Men and Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pluck away from us. The time is coming when every mans foundation ſhall be tryed, he only that is built upon the Rock ſhall then ſtand. To be able in an evil day to ſit ſtill with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage and calm ſerenity upon our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a great felicity: The only way to do this is to be able to truſt in the Lord, and with all grounded confidence to rely upon his Power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fidelity: This is no common thing, but the priviledge only of a few, and thoſe ſuch whom God (having ſet his Love upon them in Chriſt) hath taken to be his poſsesſion, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the number of his Children. To be of this number is to be happy indeed: to know our ſelves ſo, is a beam of light ſo full of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that nothing but heaven and glory can afford any more ſatisfying. Could we draw all the water out of this Well, it would make us
<pb facs="tcp:100127:3"/> to think our ſelves in Heaven before we come there. But the Well is deep, and our line too ſhort, and bucket too ſhallow, whence they are but ſips and ſmall draughts we here obtain. Some of theſe you may poſſibly find in the enſuing diſcourſe, And had my skill anſwered my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and the excellency of the ſubject, they had been far larger and more refreſhing: Yet I truſt (God affording his bleſſing with them) they may not be altogether fruitleſs: And, may they but perſwade, either ſtrangers, to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſon-ſhip, or Children to be more comforted and ſtrengthned to all patience, by the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their wonderful relation to the great God, I ſhall not have laboured in vain.

                     <bibl>I JOHN III. II.</bibl>
                     <q>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>NOt to ſeek far for the coherence of theſe Words, we may only take notice of thus much; that the Apoſtle having in the latter part of the foregoing Chapter, warned thoſe he writes to of Antichriſt; declared that there were many even at that time in the World, and given ſuch a Character of them, as might ſerve eaſily to make them known: deſcribing of them by their defection from the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and particularly their denying of Chriſt: he from thence takes an occaſion at <hi>ver.</hi> 24. to Exhort them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in maintaining the Faith which they had received at their firſt embracing of the Chriſtian Religion: unto which Exhortation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100127:5"/> (further to quicken and encourage them ſo to do) he adds divers Arguments by way of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; one of which is taken from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Adoption, prefented and preſſed in the three firſt verſes of this Chapter in the urging of which Argument, he,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> it to their conſideration as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Demonſtration of Gods inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible love to them, <hi>ver. 1. Behold what manner of love;</hi> and ſuch love requires great fidelity in thoſe that partake in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obviates an Objection which might be framed againſt it: <hi>viz.</hi> if we are ſuch, and ſo beloved, how is it then that we are ſo contemned and trampled upon by the World, as thoſe that are of no value, but a meer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> off-ſcouring? he gives a ſatisfactory reaſon for this, becauſe of the ignorance of the Men of the World, they know not God, and therefore they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Children: if they knew him, they could not but ſee his Image in them; but becauſe they do not, therefore are they not competent Judges, nor are we to be diſcouraged though they reject and perſecute us, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Aſſerts their Son-ſhip notwithſtanding this: Text: wherein he tacitly inſinuates that if we would make a true judgement of our ſtate, we muſt not then call in ſence to umpire it, but conclude according to the Rules of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100127:5"/>
                  <p>4. Shews that the Sons of God are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under a diſguiſe, and look not like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but withal hints that there is a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they ſhall: Text.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Urgeth the hope of ſuch a diſcovery or manifeſtation of the Sons of God as a ſufficient Argument to preſs us to piety and purity, <hi>ver. 3. Every man that hath this hope in him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> this hope hath enough in it to ſettle us and keep us from ſhaking.</p>
                  <p>The words of the Text are a fixt Concluſion againſt all the miſgiving Objections of Fleſh and Blood, eſtabliſhing the truth of our preſent ſtate of Adoption, without any doubting or queſtioning of it.</p>
                  <p>The Emphaſis of the aſſertion lies in the word [Now] and it looks either backward to the words foregoing, or forward to theſe that follow: it ſtands between two dark Clouds, and ſcatters them both. He had told them of this great dignity, and glorious title, but ſence ſeemed to contradict, and ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we are Sons, why then are we not known? are not the Children of a Prince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Subjects? but the World tramples us into the duſt, and perſecutes us unto death, and would God ſuffer this, if he was our Father? well, ſaith he, they neither do know you nor him, and a Princes Son is of no repute with him that know him not from a Peaſant, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100127:6"/> for all this you are Sons; and your Father knows you, though the World doth not, and that may ſatisfie you: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we were Sons we ſhould be in a more happy condition, whether the World knew it or no: but we live in the midſt of ſorrows and ſufferings both of body and mind; we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed and almoſt overwhelmed with miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and is this the portion of Sons? do Kings wont to neglect their Children, and ſuffer them to live in miſery? well, but ſtill this ſhakes not the concluſion: for, although the happineſs we are entituled unto, appears not as yet, yet now we are Sons, and there ſhall a time come, when we ſhall be made to look like ſuch.</p>
                  <p>We may firſt take the aſſertion it ſelf into our conſideration, <hi>now are we the Sons of God,</hi> and from hence we may obſerve this;</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pooreſt and moſt deſpiſed Believers in the World are now the Sons of God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch as had received the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointing of the Spirit, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. 27. of ſuch as had known the Father and believed on Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14. and theſe are they whom he pronounceth owners of this happy title.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider: 1. What is meant by being the Sons of God? 2. How we come to be his Sons? 3. What is the profit or advantage coming to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100127:6"/> us by this relation? 4. The evidence, or how it appears that we are ſuch?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is meant by being the Sons of God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Title of a Son is a title of Relation, and hath a Father for its correlate: God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to aſſume this Relation to himſelf, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it between him and his Creatures, that ſo he may expreſs his love and goodneſs to them, by ſuch things as may carry, to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the greateſt evidence or demonſtration; Father and Son among Men are relates ſtanding very near one to another, and have ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations and reſpects in them, as very nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that Covenant relation which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his People: Hence it is Anolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically expreſſed: the ſame affections and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that Fathers bear to their Sons, the ſame doth God to his People; the ſame intereſt that Children have in their Fathers love and care, the ſame have Believers in God.</p>
                  <p>Now among Men perſons come to bear the denomination of Sons in two wayes; <hi>viz.</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by natural Generation, or voluntary Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. After the former of theſe wayes God hath but one Son, begotten by an eternal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declarable Generation: after the latter he hath many Sons, <hi>even as many as believe in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. So that by the Sons of God we are to underſtand all thoſe of the Children of Men, who, by Gods free Adoption are made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100127:7"/> to bear the relation, title and priviledges of his Children. It is a word borrowed from the cuſtoms among Men, who when they Adopt one to be their Heir, do give him the title of their Son, and although it differ from that in two main points, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God was not put upon it thus to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt any becauſe of the deficiency or want of a natural Son, which is the main incentive to it among Men, that ſo they may have one to Heir their Eſtates: nor yet becauſe his Son had given him any juſt provocation to reject and disinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit him, for which Men do ſometimes abdicate their own Children, and adopt a Stranger: No, God had an only begotten Son, in whom he placed his delight from all Eternity, who had never given him any diſpleaſure in the leaſt, but had afforded him everlaſting ſatisfaction; yea, then when his Father put him upon the higheſt proof of filial obedience, calling him to do and die for ſinful man, he cheerfully replied, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will Oh God:</hi> Pſal. 40. 7. this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption therefore was an effect of his abundant overflowing Grace, that it ſhould be the good pleaſure of his Holy Will to joyn poor Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto, and admit them to be made coheirs with Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Joynt Heirs with Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God doth not do it to make them inherit by way of ſucceſſion, which is the caſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100127:7"/> among men; and the ground and deſign of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Adoption, being becauſe man is mortal, and muſt in a ſhort time die, and leave all his earthly poſſeſſions and name behind him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hence, that they may have one to bear up the their name, and poſſeſs their livings, which they can no longer in perſon enjoy, they ſubſtitute one in their room: ſo that as long as the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter lives, the adopted is kept out of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and muſt be content to wait for his portion, till the other goes off, and is often in the mean while put to many and hard ſhifts: whereas God lives for ever, and yet Believers are not entituled to, but have actual participation in all the good things of God, according to their preſent ſtate and capacity, immediately after their Adoption, and eternally. Men ſay, when I die you ſhall inherit, but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>becauſe I live you ſhall live alſo.</hi> I ſay, although in theſe things it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers (and evermore the antitype is ſomething more glorious than the Type) yet in the main notions of Adoption they agree: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As that, ſo this makes an abſolutely free choice of the ſubject: if men do, much more God may take a liberty to do with his own what he pleaſeth: the Adopted could have laid no claim to his Title if it had not been freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him, he can give no other reaſon for it, but the good will of him who choſe him unto it: if he had left him out, and named
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100127:8"/> another in his will, he could not have charged it as any wrong done unto him. Gods Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an act of free Grace, and a diſcovery of his greateſt love. Context <hi>ver. 1. Behold what manner of love,</hi> &amp;c. it is ſaid there to be a love <hi>given,</hi> or <hi>beſtowed,</hi> and how free it is will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the antiquity of the Foundation of it: it was founded in Gods eternal Decree, where we were choſen to this priviledge, <hi>Eph. 1. 5. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. when the creature had no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſequently could have no deſerving more then the other poſſible Beings, or his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, who were left out of this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then God reſolved upon it, and writ it down in his Book of life, who they were that ſhould be his Children and Heirs: then he took down their Names, and wrote them for the inheritance of Glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the condition of thoſe who are made partakers in this Grace, at ſuch time as they are admitted unto it: Adoption came in upon effectual vocation; and when God comes to call ſinners home to himſelf, he finds them ſtrangers from God, and from the Covenant, <hi>Eph. 2. 12. at that time ye were aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe:</hi> they were alſo worthleſs creatures; they muſt all ſay as the returning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100127:8"/> Prodigal, <hi>Luk. 15. 21. I am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> they have nothing in them to render them more amiable or deſirable in the eyes of God, when God looks on them with an eye of Fatherly pity, he finds them rowling and wallowing in their own blood, <hi>Ezek. 16. 5. When thou waſt in thy Blood, I ſaid unto thee live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the meritorious and procuring cauſe of this Adoption, <hi>viz.</hi> the Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt: for although Chriſt did not merit that God ſhould purpoſe to Adopt us; Gods Decree being abſolutely and every way free, and the Redemption of Chriſt being a part, and not a meritorious cauſe of that Decree; yet Chriſt merited our actual Adoption for us: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reckoned among the fruits of his Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, <hi>Gal. 4. 4, 5. God ſent his Son to redeem, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons:</hi> had man had any deſert of his own, yea had he not been laden with indeſert, there had not needed the intervention of the great price paid for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome from the Law, before he could be actually made a Child.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the way in which it comes, <hi>viz.</hi> by receiving Chriſt, and believing on him, <hi>John 1. 12. As many as received him to them he gave power</hi> (or priviledge) <hi>to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed on his Name.</hi> Now Faith it ſelf is a free gift, and every part of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100127:9"/> that comes with it, <hi>Eph. 2. 8, 9. By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> yea the very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and ordering of Goſpel priviledges to be introduced by Faith, is on purpoſe for the declaration of Gods free Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As that, ſo this beſtows the Relation and Title of a Child: he hath both the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and propriety of a Child in reſpect to the perſon adopting of him: ſee the words of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> concerning <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Gen. 48. 5. <hi>as Reuben and Simeon they ſhall be mine:</hi> he bears the Adopters name, and hath from him ſuch affections as if he were his own Child: thus are Believers; the Name of God is called upon them, and they have the condition no longer of Enemies, nor yet of Servants, but of Children, <hi>Gal. 4. 7. Wherefore thou art no longer a Servant, but a Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As that, ſo this gives to him that is adopted the priviledges of a Son by natural Generation: what ſuch an one may chalenge as his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, the ſame may this perſon chalenge by vertue of this choice: Believers have not a bare empty Title, but a Title which brings benefit along with it to him that receiveth it: they have all the priviledges, immunities, and advantages which belong to ſuch a Relation, as far as they are capable, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Joynt heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 4. 7. <hi>If a Son then an Heir of God through
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100127:9"/> Chriſt.</hi> What theſe are will follow afterwards.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>How we come to be his Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> That we are his by Adoption we heard in the former: here therefore we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the way in which we are brought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in this Adoption: for although this (as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Grace) is rooted in the Decree of God yet it is communicated to us in his ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and particularly in the work of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Here therefore let us obſerve in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that when God beſtows the Grace of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption upon any, he doth, in order to it, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, put the heart of a Son into him; which is more than Men can do for ſuch as they chuſe, who can do no more then expreſs their kindneſs to them in external things, and in this reſpect, although, to expreſs the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Relation which Chriſt, and which Believers have unto God, it is repreſented under the notion of Adoption; for Believers are not, as Chriſt is, his Sons by eternal Generation; yet as to the way in which they are brought to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in this priviledge, it is reſembled by natural Generation, whence they are not only ſaid to be Adopted by, but alſo to be born of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. Whatſoever is born of God,</hi> John 1. 13. <hi>Which were born:</hi> to <hi>be</hi> begotten, <hi>Jam. 1. 18. Of his own Will he begat us:</hi> and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Regeneration or the new-birth, <hi>John 3. 3. Except a Man be born again,</hi> which, how it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100127:10"/> wrought, the Apoſtle briefly tells us, <hi>Gal. 3. 26. Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> and we may take up a gueſs at it in theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Son-ſhip is properly an act of our Communion or Fellowſhip with Chriſt: hence we are ſaid to be <hi>joynt Heirs with him,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. and it muſt needs be ſo, for he was firſtly appointed by his Father to be <hi>Heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. Now, inaſmuch as the whole Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is his by his Fathers donation; hence if we do inherit, it muſt needs be in partnerſhip with him: the Title of Sons and Heirs doth not paſs from him to us, by way of alienation, it ceaſeth not to be his by becoming ours, and therefore it muſt needs be in a way of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our union with Chriſt is the true and proper ground of our Communion with him in all his benefits: the Title can in no propriety of Speech be ſaid to be both his and ours too; but as he and we are ſome way to be looked upon as one: and upon this account it is, that the Scripture alſo expreſſeth our Son-ſhip under the relation of our Marriage to Chriſt; ſo that by becoming his Spouſe, in that way alſo we are made the Children of God: Hence that <hi>Hoſ. 2. 19, 20. I will betroth thee to mee,</hi> &amp;c. and 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 2. I have eſpouſed you to one Husband,</hi> which Relation of Marriage, brings the party ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100127:10"/> into actual Communion in all that belongs to the Husband.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Union is the fruit and effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith is the Bond of this Union on our part: it is that whereby we give up our ſelves to Chriſt, and to him alone, utterly renouncing our intereſt and truſt in all other things: it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whereby we cleave unto him with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart, to be for him, and for no other: this is in the very nature of juſtifying Faith; and hence we ſhall find it frequently expreſt in the Scripture under ſuch phraſes as theſe are, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are ſynonimical.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Faith is the true and proper product of the Spirit in our Regeneration: that which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> begotten and brought forth in us, is Faith: all that is before it in the Soul, is onlie preparatory unto it; all that is concomitant with it, is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from it; all Grace in us, is called Faith in Scripture, becauſe that is the principal Grace wrought in us. Gods Elect are by nature dead, but the Spirit quickens them, <hi>Eph. 2. beginning.</hi> and how doth he ſo? why by cauſing them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: for the life of Regeneration is properly a life of Faith, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I live by the Faith of the Son of God;</hi> ſo that when by the operation of the Spirit in him, a man is made to believe, he is then and not till then born of God, he is then alſo married to Chriſt; Chriſt marries with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100127:11"/> none that are dead; he finds them indeed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead when he comes to them; but he firſt quickens them by his Grace, cauſing them to believe, and ſo to live, and as ſuch he takes them into this nearneſs of relation to himſelf, and ſo they are together and at once born of God, and eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is the profit and advantage coming by this Relation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> uſing it as a preſent Argument to engage us to conſtancy in times of Antichriſtian Tyrany, thereby intimates that it is a relation of infinite worth, and would have us therefore to conſider of it, and take a large view of its worth and eminency; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is ſo much in it as we may loſe our ſelves in the contemplation: all the good which is wrapt up in the promiſe, is made ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and becomes the propriety of the Believer in and by his Son-ſhip; I cannot rehearſe all, but the choice advantages of Adoption are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> as theſe that follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Name and Title it ſelf is a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage: it is a dignity, an honour, to be called the Children of God: the Apoſtle ſeems to place much weight upon the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it ſelf, <hi>ver. 1. What manner of love, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God? Jacob</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>Joſeph's</hi> two eldeſt Sons, when he willed that his name ſhould be called upon them; ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100127:11"/> doth the great God the Children of Men, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n he is pleaſed that his Name ſhould come into their Title; that thoſe who were before by way of Diſgrace called <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons, and Children of Hell, Children of Wrath, Children of the Devil, ſhould riſe, and be henceforth called the Children of God: this very Title declares theſe to be made noble by their new-birth, who by their natural birth were ignoble. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men accounted an high thing to be the Son of ſome King or Emperour, 1 <hi>Sam. 18. 23. Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Son in law?</hi> what is it then for God to call us his Sons and Daughters, and to give us leave to call him our Father? as 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 18, I will be to you a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you ſhall be my Sons and Daughters ſaith the Lord God Almighty:</hi> and Jer. 14. 9. <hi>we are called by thy Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are taken into Gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that not as Servants but as Children, there to abide for ever, <hi>Joh. 8. 35. The Servant abideth not in the Houſe for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</hi> Believers therefore are all one Houſhold, called the <hi>Houſhold of Faith,</hi> Gal 6. 10. and they are of Gods Family after another manner then wicked Men and inferiour creatures: God after a more common way, and by a more general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence looks after the World and all the affairs of it; all creatures come under his care, and for that reaſon the whole Creation is his great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100127:12"/> but theſe Children are under his ſpecial inſpection and care, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 7. Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> In ſum, they being Children have him for a Father: And hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He will certainly provide for them, and they need not to puzzle their minds, or diſtract their thoughts about any ſuch thing; for he will conſider all their wants, and ſend them relief; they ſhall have whatſoever they ſtand in need of, and they ſhall have it as they need it, <hi>Mat. 6. 31, 32. take no thought,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that you have need of theſe things:</hi> if others in a Family ſuffer want, and be pincht with difficulties, yet the Children ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be taken care for, as long as there is any thing to be had: they are hard times indeed when Children are denied that which is needful for them: Hence that <hi>Pſal. 34. 10. Young Lions are brought to want, and ſuffer hunger, but they that fear the Lord ſhall want for no good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He will protect them from all harms and injuries: and that both by defending of them from their Enemies, and alſo by righting of their wronged cauſe: and at all times, and in all caſes whatſoever, they may with greateſt ſafety, and without any fear leave it with him, and in it he will not leave him, <hi>Heb. 13. 5, 6. He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee, ſo that we may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, and I will
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100127:12"/> not fear.</hi> It is hard for earthly Parents to deſer their Children, and when they ſee them wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to hold their peace, and neither ſay, nor do any thing to right them: it is certain God will not, nay he cannot, <hi>Pſal. 27. 10. When my Father and my Mother forſake me then the Lord will take me up.</hi> Jer. 2. 2. <hi>All that devour him ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, evil ſhall come upon them ſaith the Lord,</hi> Zech. 2. 8. <hi>He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He will uphold them from falling: he will take them by their hand, and ſtay their ſteps for them, ſuſtein them, keep them from undoing themſelves; hence thoſe promiſes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God,</hi> Pſal. 91. 11, 12. Gods Sons in this life are like little Children, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes tripping, and ſtumbling, and falling, and ſo weak that they could never get up again but for him: but by reaſon of his hand that is upon them, his everlaſting Arm that is under them, hence if they fall at any time through incogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, or by ſtumbling at any thing that lies in their way, or through that weakneſs that attends them, or by Satans malice thruſting at them, he will lift them up again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He will counſel and direct them: they are tender and fooliſh in themſelves, they have not wiſdom enough of their own to order and direct their way; and are therefore eaſily ſe duced and cheated by the adverſary, who is ſubtle, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100127:13"/> watcheth all advantages againſt: but he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giving them his Fatherly advice, warning them of their danger, ſhewing them a way how to eſcape it: they have the voice of his Spirit behind them, telling them this is the way, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 21. they have the guidance of his moſt wiſe counſel to keep them in the right way unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7424.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He will aſſiſt and ſtrengthen them, he will lend them an helping hand to carry them through all their difficulties, temptations, ſtraits that they are engaged or involved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in, in their Chriſtian courſe, and the diſcharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all of them, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 17. The Lord was with me, and ſtrengthened me:</hi> they have a great work to perform to ſerve God in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but his Grace ſtanding by them, becomes their ſufficiency: a Fathers love draws forth his helping hand, to aſſiſt his Son, and carry him well through all that is before him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He will Correct and Chaſten them for their Faults. <hi>Heb. 12. 6. He chaſtneth every ſon whom He receiveth.</hi> They (like fooliſh Children) may now reckon this for their damage; but it is indeed none of the leaſt of thoſe benefits which the Children of God do enjoy. God lets wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men alone to go on in their pernicious wayes: They have their wills in the world, that they may be deſtroyed for ever: But God here afflicts his Children, that their ſouls may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100127:13"/> in the day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 32. We are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. He will commend and encourage them when they do well: ſee what an high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation he gives <hi>Abraham</hi> for his love, and what a precious promiſe he gives him upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 16, 17. the pooreſt ſervices which they do, being done in ſincerity to him, if it be but a cup of cold water given to one of his Diſciples, in that Name, ſhall not loſe its acceptance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: yea ſuch is his Fathers reſpect, that he owns and crowns the very good will, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, as much as if they really performed them: <hi>David</hi> doth but reſolve to build an Houſe to his Name and Glory, and God takes it kindly, and promiſeth richly upon it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. theſe things belong unto them as they are Children in the Family, and carry Conſolation in the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They receive the ſpirit of Adoption, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Gal.</hi> 4. 5, 6. and here we are to obſerve, that the Spirit of Adoption doth not decipher any diſtinct ſpirit, but that it is one and the ſame ſpirit who doth illuminate, convince, humble, engraft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſoul into Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it deciphers to us a diſtinct and peculiar obſervation of the Spirit of God in us: ſo that the dignity of this priviledge is to be diſcovered in the effects which are conſequent upon it, and they are ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100127:14"/>
                  <p>1. The obſignation, or ſealing up of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the certain and infallible enjoyment of their inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. &amp; 4. 30. when God hath once admitted a poor Soul into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Children, he now confirms and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies to him all the promiſes, and makes them unto him ſurer than the foundation of the World: yea, ſo ſure that neither outward Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor inward Evils ſhall ever be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of this Title, <hi>Rom. 8. 39, 39. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that neither height nor depth, &amp;c. ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt.</hi> It is poſſible that they may not alwayes with alike clearneſs diſcern it, ſome cloud or other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, but it is ever with an equal certainty therein, inaſmuch as it is a gift of God, that is without Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The teſtimony which the ſpirit of God gives in to their ſtate of Adoption, witneſſing in them that God hath numbred them to his Children, and joyned them in the inheritance of all bleſſings with his own Son, <hi>Rom. 8. 16, 17. The ſpirit it ſelf leaveth witneſs,</hi> &amp;c. The effect conſequent upon this teſtimony is aſſurance, which aſſurance is in it ſelf a piece of inchoate Glorification, but the witneſs which the Spirit of God bears in us by vertue of which we are confirmed in this knowledge, is a priviledge of Adoption: and though Believers do not alwayes ſo diſtinctly hear him teſtifying, and to be able
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100127:14"/> to draw the comfort of it to their Souls, yet they have alwayes this witneſs in them, becauſe the Spirit of God is ever with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The enlivening of their Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enabling of them to God to God as a Father, and claim this Relation, and upon the claim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly to plead with him for the acceptance of their perſons, the audience of their Prayers, the granting of their requeſts, and ſupplying of all their wants, <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father:</hi> yea the ſpirit of God enables them thus to act Faith in conſideration of this relation, not only in times of outward favour, when the candle of the Lord ſhineth upon their Tabernacle, and all things go well with them, but alſo in the moſt cloudy times of darkeſt diſpenſations, when God hides his face from them, and carries it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them as if he were their Enemy: hence that chalenge of Faith at ſuch an hour, <hi>Iſai. 63. 17. Doubtleſs thou art our Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The powerful preſervation of them in a ſtate of Grace, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Who are kept by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are weak in themſelves, and ly open to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrong temptations: and if they were left to themſelves, thoſe floods that aſſail them, would eaſily and quickly drown them: But the ſpirit of God is ſtill blowing upon this ſpark, and ſupplying of it with new fuel, whereby he makes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100127:15"/> the faith of Believers to live and flouriſh, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of all thoſe endeavours that are uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and ruin it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His conſtant aſſiſtance in ſpiritual duties enabling them to perform them acceptably; and particularly in the great duty of Prayer to God, <hi>Rom. 8. 26, 27. We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> &amp;c. they are weak to do duty, and carry about in them a maſſe of corruption, a body of Death, which preſſeth them down; evil is ever preſent when they would be doing of good, ſo that without him they can do nothing, and it would be a vain thing for them to ſet about any ſervice to God in their own ſtrength: but he ſtands by them, and is ready to put to his helping hand, ſupplying them with the influences of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Grace, whence, when they are weak in themſelves, they are ſtrong in him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To communicate to them the diſcoveries of the love of God, and thereby to fill them with ſpiritual rejoycing, <hi>Rom. 5. 5.

                  <p n="4">4. They are made to partake in Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>Joh. 8. 36. If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, you are free indeed,</hi> which liberty is not (as vain men would have it) a freedome to live as they liſt; a liberty diſcharging them from holy Obedience to the commanding power of the Law of God, and withal bidding them to truſt in Chriſt for life and ſalvation, as Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines plead: but it is an holy, ſpiritual Liberty; a Liberty from Bondage or Servitude, <hi>Gal. 4. 7. viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſervitude of the Law; not from the regulating power of it: for it ſtill remains to be the directory of the People of God in their whole courſe, and hath the ſtrongeſt tye to obedience that can be from the Goſpel, <hi>Joh. 14. 15. If ye love me keep my Commandment;</hi> nay, whatſoever fleſh may plead to the contrary, it is certain that ſo to be loſed from the Law, were not a priviledge but a miſery: but it is a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from ſlaviſh ſubjection to the Law. <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the ſervitude of the Law, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100127:16"/> power of it: from the thundring curſes of it, <hi>Gal. 3. 13. Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law.</hi> The Law hath doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all its offenders to eternal death, and by the ſentence of it they are held under guilt: but Gods Adopted are ſet at liberty from this doom: it ſpeaks nothing that needs to appall them; there is no ſpirit of bondage in it to them: they are not under the law as a Judge, but only as a Guid, a Light, and a Lamp.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From any dependance upon the Law for happineſs in a way of works or doings, <hi>Rom. 3. 28. We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> This is a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bondage to fallen man, thus to depend upon the Law: Becauſe it preſents thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it every day with that which may aſſure them, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> after all their labour and pains taken in legal obedience, they ſhall certainly loſe all, and finally fall ſhort of Bleſſedneſs: for, <hi>by the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified, for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From ſervile Obedience to the Law: their ſervice is now a ſervice of love; for faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love: before this, he had the workings and ſtirrings of his Conſcience, which by ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing terrors, and diſmal frights, drave him to the performance of known duty, and reſtrained him from the commiſſion of many erronious ſins; but all this was againſt his will, and glad
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100127:16"/> he would have been, might he but have enjoyed ſome relaxation, but now the caſe is altered: and he takes delight in the Law of God, and it is a great pleaſure to him to be found exerciſing of himſelf therein, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From ſin, <hi>Rom. 6. 7. For he that is dead is freed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from ſin:</hi> Hence that 1 <hi>John 3. 9. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is born of God doth not commit ſin,</hi> not but that there are the remainders of active and ſtirring corruption to be found in the beſt of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as long as they bear about with them a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Death; and hence <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſo earneſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though ſin be in him, yet it reigns not, <hi>Rom. 6. 12. Let not ſin therefore reign in your mortal body:</hi> it hath not the full compliance of the heart with it; but whenever it gains upon him, it is by leading of him captive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. he is enthralled by it, and that appears becauſe he is grieved at it, as one that is taken a Priſoner by his Enemy; and hence he ſighs and groans for a delivery, <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though ſin be yet God imputes it not, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 29. Not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them:</hi> the ſin of Gods Children being ſet upon the account of Jeſus Chriſt, it is no longer charged upon them; for God having taken full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for it at his hands, and he having anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, we are righteous in his account.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though ſin be yet it ſhall never condemn
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100127:17"/> them, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> he complains of the preſence and oppreſſion of it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. but is here comforted againſt the condemning efficacy of it: he is freed from the dominion of that ſlaviſh Spirit, or ſpirit of bondage, and needs not to go up and down in fear of ſuffering the eternal weight of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the World, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the World:</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and kept from being drawn away with thoſe ſnares, baits, and temptations, and terified with thoſe threatnings which the World ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: hence they have ſuch liberty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit granted them, that they can both trample in diſdain upon the large proffers of the World to ſeduce them by from their profeſſion; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly hold up their hands, againſt all the menaces that are made againſt them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A liberty to ſerve God. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That oppoſition which was in their hearts againſt God is taken down, and they are brought under voluntary obedience to his Holy Will: their wills that were diſordered, are ſet in their right place again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They love God and all his wayes, yea, they dearly love him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. their whole ſoul is now devoted to him and his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They perform filial obedience to God, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 14. As obedient Children;</hi> they have not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100127:17"/> only the ſtate and condition of Sons conferred upon them: but alſo the hearts of Children put into them: Hence Adoption comes in upon Converſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All the creatures of God, as it were, put under them, being uſed by him for their ſervice: and that in three reſpects;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have the ſervice of the good things of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 20. All is yours:</hi> they are made beneficial to them, they are their own: all that a Believer enjoys in this life he may truly call his own, as he is a child of God: the right uſing of the Creatures is again enlarged and reſtored unto them: wicked men indeed have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward civil right, a providential right, but ſtill they are liable to anſwer for all they have, and by their miſuſing of theſe things, and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God by them, they encreaſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and lay up for themſelves treaſures of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. but they have a ſpiritual right, and all their enjoyments are theirs by the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have the Miniſtry of the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Heb. 1. 14. Are they not all miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation:</hi> Thoſe glorious Beings which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend before the Throne of God, are alſo made to wait upon Gods Children, they guard theſe Heirs of Salvation; they are unto them tutelary Angels to defend them from evil, and to watch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100127:18"/> for their good, <hi>Pſal. 91. 11. He ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge concerning thee:</hi> they pitch their tents round about them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 1. they bring them meſſages of peace from Heaven, even anſwers of their Prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23. they ſtrengthen and confirm them in their ſecret conflicts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 43. and when they come to die, they are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy to carry their Souls home to eternal reſt, <hi>Luk. 16. 22. The Angels carried Lazarus into Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams boſom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have the cooperation of all things to do them good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. Gods Children are called to paſs through varieties of changes in this life, they meet with manifold afflictions, they have many enemies, men and devils that are engaged to plot their harm, and take all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to bring it about; but yet all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-ruled by the power and wiſdom of God which ſtand on his peoples ſide, are made bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to them, and whatever they plot for evil, is turned to good; and (though ſorely againſt their will, whom nothing more grieves then the welfare of the Saints) all helps them forward for heaven, and contributes to the encreaſe of their eternal glory: every reproach and injury doth but add weight to their Crown.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are made Royal Heirs: they are conjoyned with Jeſus Chriſt in the glorious inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that is prepared, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Joynt Heirs with Chriſt:</hi> they are, as Children of the great
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100127:18"/> King, entituled to a Kingly eſtate: yea they are conſtituted Heirs of all things: God is theirs, Chriſt is theirs, the Throne and Crown that are prepared, and the exceeding eternal weight of Glory are theirs: and though for the preſent, during their nonage and minority here in this life, they ſeem but little different from ſervants to the obſervation of others, their Inheritance being as yet in reverſion, and they mean while under manifold exerciſes of their graces, yet ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, when they are made perfect men in Chriſt, and (having finiſhed the work ſet them to do in this World) ſhall be brought to take full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their own, it ſhall then be known what happy ones they are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the evidence of the Doctrine, or wherein it appears that they are now the Sons of God, notwithſtanding their preſent deſpicable condition: here take only two Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is nothing in their preſent mean and deſpicable eſtate, but what is well enough conſiſtent with their Sonſhip: though they are hated, deſpiſed, perſecuted, afflicted, and every way as low and mean as is to be imagined: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the World hates them is rather an evidence of their Sonſhip, than any Argument againſt it; as being an exerciſe, and diſcovery of that enmity which God hath put between the ſeed of the Serpent &amp; of the Woman. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is the Father of ungodly Men, is Gods
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100127:19"/> great Enemy, and the ringleader of Rebellion againſt him; and no wonder, ſince he cannot touch God in his Being, if Hell riſe up againſt him, and oppoſe him in his Children: It is true that wicked men do not know them to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Children of God, <hi>for the world know us not,</hi> ver. 1. but they know them to be other kind of men from themſelves, and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they hate and perſecute them: our Saviour foretold his Diſciples, that they muſt expect to meet this meaſure from the World, and gives the reaſon, <hi>Mat. 10. 22. Ye ſhall be hated of all men for my Name ſake:</hi> it is for the profeſſion which they make and the glory of God which they are bound for, that they are hated and ſcorned in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God ſuffers the World to afflict and perſecute them, denies not his fatherly care of them; for in this very thing he makes men and devils to ſerve them: there is no Saint that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, or ever ſhall be a loſer by all that Gods and his Enemies ſhall do againſt him: and that becauſe what they intend for harm, God ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, by a powerful over-ruling providence, turns for their good: his Graces are hereby tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made to ſhine forth, and that trial proves to be much better than that of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. God hereby puts an advantage into his hands to glorifie him, and teſtifying his love and ſincerity to him, in chearfully ſuffering all
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100127:19"/> things for his Name: and Faith at ſuch a time, teacheth him to rejoyce that he may be counted worthy for this, ſo did the Apoſtles when ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before the Council, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. and when wicked men have done their worſt to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, they do but prepare for them a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chariot to ride home in tryumph to the City of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they are low and mean in the world is not becauſe God loves wicked men better than he loves them, whom he ſuffers to flouriſh, and abound in all delights, to live at eaſe and die without bands; but becauſe ſuch a condition in this life is uſually beſt for them: and ſtill when they are moſt diſtreſſed, poor, and bare, they are his choſen, they are rich, becauſe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is their portion, and a Kindom is prepared for them, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 6. as long as they are here they are from home; they are Strangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and it is ſafeſt for them to be ſo, and ſtill that remains to be a great truth, <hi>Pſal. 37. 16. A little that a righteous man hath, is better than the riches of many wicked:</hi> better becauſe it is his own, and he hath it with Gods favour and love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That God is often angry with them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts them, and withdraws the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from them, and puts them to grief, is not becauſe he loves them not, but becauſe it is that which their preſent condition requires: they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100127:20"/> are but Children, and childiſh, and fooliſh, and if they were not ſometimes chaſtened, they would grow wanton, and careleſs of Duty: a Fathers love is evidenced as well in correcting a wanton child, as in providing for him: God doth it to ſhew his love, <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Whom he loves he corrects:</hi> he doth it for the ſaving of their Souls, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 32. Ye are judged of the Lord, that ye may not be condemned with the World:</hi> when the time comes, that all their ſin is done away, then they ſhall ſorrow no more: ſo that in all this way, how dark ſoever it ſeems to be, God is guiding them by counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he may bring them to glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In this mean and deſpiſed eſtate of theirs, God is pleaſed to be giving of them many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies and clear evidences of their Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: this was one thing that <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to know, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. and this the Children of God do know, inaſmuch as they ſuffer for his Name ſake, and in his cauſe, and that the Name of God may be glorified in their ſufferings; and alſo becauſe he ſupplies them with patience and conſtancy therein, for that they do not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and hereby they come to know that bleſſedneſs is theirs, <hi>Mat. 5. 12. Rejoyce and be glad, for great is your reward in Heaven; for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:100127:20"/> They are made to underſtand that being jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The fruits of the ſpirit in them, working in all the graces thereof in their ſouls, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their free exerciſe: Their love to God, their faith in Chriſt, their hope of Glory, their hatred of ſin, their delighting of themſelves in holineſs, &amp;c.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100127:34"/> for the place, will be wondrouſly glorious; and their knowing of ſo much of it, makes them ſo extreamly envious at them and their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But ſtill, after what manner the Bride, the Lambs Wife, ſhal be entertained in the great day, when the marriage ſhal be conſummate, &amp; he ſhal carry her home to his own Pallace, they cannot tell, the Angels of Glory cannot know it, but by relation, and we cannot ſuppoſe that God will make ſpecial diſcoveries now to the Devils: They may remember what the place was by Creation, but what it ſhal be when Chriſt hath further prepared it, is not for them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth not appear to wicked men, what the Sons of God ſhal be: The World are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and intermeddle not with their joy: The truth is, the World are ſo far from knowing what they ſhal be, that they do not know what they are at preſent: There are Inchoate felicitys which the Saints have in this life, which unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men have no notice, or cognizance of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have their feaſts, their joyes, their conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, their boaſtings, that are riddles to the ungodly: They know not what the countrey feaſt of a good Conſcience means, how then ſhould they underſtand what are the Proviſions of the Kingdom of Glory? The Children of God have their joyes and raviſhments here, and theſe ſtrangers have no acquaintance with them.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100127:35"/> Sound Divines interpret that, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9. Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="3">3. The Children of God themſelves whiles they are here, do not fully know what they ſhal be, it doth not yet appear to them:</p>
                  <p>It is true,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Word of God hath ſaid a great deal concerning their future Glory.

                  <p n="2">2. The People of God have their ſips and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100127:35"/> and firſt fruits of this Glory here: They are made to taſt of thoſe Graps of which the Wine is made in <hi>Canaan:</hi> They have not only their aſſurances, but alſo ſometimes their exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: They are taken into the Mount, rapt up into the third Heaven, their ſouls are lifted up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the world, and all that is in it. God is pleaſed at ſome times to carry them out ſo farr in their meditations, and reveal ſo much of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his infinit love to their contemplation, that they are loth to come down, or to have any thing more to do with the ſink and puddle of this world: They know ſo much of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate,, that when they are under theſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcoveries, and the irradiations of the ſpirit of God upon their ſouls, they cry out, Who will give me the wings of a Dove, that I might mount up and be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gone: And with <hi>Paul</hi> their hearts are carried forth with a longing deſire to depart and be with him in full poſſeſſion of all this Glory: But,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. God makes it not known to the ungodly,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Leſt they ſhould be allured by it: All which they hear and enjoy here muſt therefore be Aenigmatical or obſcure to them, leſt they ſhould be converted; it is an awful word, but Chriſt himſelf hath ſpoken it, who knew his Fathers, and his own mind and purpoſe, <hi>Mar. 4. 11. 12. To them that are without theſe things are done in parables,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Leſt at any time they ſhould be Converted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may by Perſecutions and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions try the Graces of his Children: There is great uſe and fruit in this tryal, it is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than that of Gold: And God is pleaſed to uſe wicked men as inſtruments of the tryal: And hence they ſhall not know who theſe be, nor what their Glory is; for if they did, they would without doubt ſuſpend, if not in love, yet in fear of them: Chriſt himſelf muſt come in a diſguiſe that ſo the determined Counſel of God might be fulfilled i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon alſo why the People of God themſelves have no comprehenſive diſcovery of their own future eſtate,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is too big a ſight for their weak eyes to gaze upon: They muſt be prepared for their Glory, as well as their Glory for them, or elſe it would ſwallow them up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt is upon the one work in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Spirit of Chriſt is on the other here. Should a full deſcription of that ſtate be given us, it muſt be in a Language which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.

Not unlawful, becauſe forbidden by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but becauſe they did out-bid his ability. If the Glory to be revealed, ſhould now be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in this our imperfect ſtate, it would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver oppreſs and ſink us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they may with more patience abide the time allotted then here, and ſerve there Generation in the doing of that work which God hath ſet out for them to do before they go to be poſſeſſed of this Glory. We find, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rapture, he had great wreſtlings with

I am in a ſtrait, between two, Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſire to depart:</hi> And ſuch have been the frames of God's dear Children, after that they have had ſome extraordinary beamings of his love, and been feaſted by him with ſome ſpecial viſits, they have been long ere they could quiet themſelves from longing and praying, that the Chain might be cut, and they might hoiſe Sail and be gone: Might the Saints be permitted to know here, as much as ſhall be known hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it would be harder perſwading them to be willing to live, than it is now to make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to dy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE,</hi> I. For informations learn we from Hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon why the Children of God are ſo little regarded here in the World; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the World knows not who they are, nor what they are born unto: Their great Glory for the preſent is within; outwardly they look like other men, they eat, drink, labour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in earthly imployments, as others do; the communion which they have with God in all of theſe, is a ſecret thing: They are Sick, Poor, Naked, Diſtreſſed like other men; thoſe in ward ſupports which they have under all thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, are remote from publick view: They dy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are buried under the Clods, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100127:37"/> putrifie and rot like other men; and none ſee thoſe joyes that their ſouls are entred into, nor that guard of Angels which comes as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, and carryes them into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom: Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, they have their ſins, their ſpots, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections and weakneſſes here, as well as other men; but their tears, repentance, ſecret mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and renewals of Faith, and reſtorings to peace and ſoul-comfort, are ſecret.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Though the Righteous Man be indeed ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly more excellent than his neighbour, yet is he not thought ſo to be: Whereas, did the World ſee and underſtand, whoſe ſons they are, what inheritances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> are the undoubted heirs of, and what are thoſe Gloryes they ſhall ere long be made to poſſeſs, it would alter their opinion, and make them afraid of them, and not dare to do them any wrong. How fearful was <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God did but tell him he was a Prophet? <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we ſee the reaſon why the People of God are often ſo doubtful, diſquiet, diſcontent, and afraid to dy (I put things together) The ground of all this is becauſe they do not as yet ſee clearly what they ſhall be: It would be a matter of juſt wonderment to ſee the Children of God ſo eaſily and often ſhaken, ſo diſturbed and perplexed in hours of Temptation, were it not from the conſideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100127:38"/> know ſo little of themſelves or their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Sometimes their ſonſhip it ſelf doth not appear to them, but they are in the dark, at a loſs about the evidencing of it to the ſatisfaction of their own minds; and from hence it is that many doubtings ariſe, and their ſouls are diſquieted. Sometimes their preſent ſufferings look bigger in their thoughts, than the conceptions or apprehenſions which they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their future Glory, theſe things being near, and the other looked on at a diſtance, and hence they out-weigh, in their raſh judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and now they are diſquiet and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſay with him, <hi>

                     </gap> good frames, they apprehend more of the ſweetneſs of preſent Communion with God in his Ordinances, than of that bleſſed immediate communion in Glory; and this makes them, with good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to turn away their faces from the meſſages of death and change: All theſe things are arguments of the weak ſight and dark thoughts which we here have of the things of another world: which yet, it is the holy pleaſure of God, that it ſhall be ſo a while, for the advancing of his own ends in his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learn hence a reaſon why the preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of God's Children can neither argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, nor yet prejudice their felicity: for the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100127:38"/> time is not yet come wherein they are to appear like themſelves: <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s priſoned condition, and priſon robes ſet him never the further off from his preferment in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court; but were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very harbingers of it: When the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God ſhall come, he can fetch them out in haſt, change them in the twinkling of an eye, and cloath them upon with all that excellency and ſplendid Glory, whereby, they who were but the other day lying among the pots, ſhall with their dazling luſtre outſhine the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is the Almighty's good pleaſure, that their life, for the preſent, ſhould be hid with Chriſt in God: But yet he hath his time, and will take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is opportunity to reveal and make it known.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This teacheth us that the Glory of the ſons of God muſt needs be wonderfully and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly great: For why? Have they not already in hand, that which ſurpaſſes the knowledge of all the world, and which is in value tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently more worth than all the Crowns and Kingdoms, and Gloryes of it? Do they not live upon, and ſatisfie their ſouls with marrow and fatneſs here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 5. Are they not here reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the fatneſs of God's houſe? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 8. Who, but he that enjoys it, can declare what an happineſs it is to enjoy peace with God, and fellowſhip with Chriſt, aſſurance of his love,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100127:39"/> and conſolation of his ſpirit? Who, but he that hath felt it, can tell what it is to have the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart, and in his Soul to hear the ſweet voice of Pardon, and promiſes of Glory? to ly all night in the boſom of Chriſt, and have his left hand underneath his head, and his right hand imbracing of him?

                  <p n="1">1. Not to judge of our ſelves, or of our own ſtate by our preſent ſenſe: It is the delight of Satan to be keeping the thoughts of the Children of God looking, and poring upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſinful and ſorrowful condition, that they may be held under diſcouragement by thinking themſelves miſerable, but we live by hope, and <hi>Hope that is ſeen is not hope, Rom.</hi> 8. 24. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten then as your ſenſe would diſhearten you, now betake your ſelves to, and ſtirr up your Faith; ſet your ſelves to meditate upon the unknown

                  <p n="3">3. Wait patiently for your Glory: though you do not now enjoy it, no nor make a full and through diſcovery of it at the preſent, yet be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and wait, and you have thoſe encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo to do.</p>

And you have all thoſe earneſts which are given in the inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive felicity, which you have found, in thoſe taſts that you have had of the love of God in Chriſt, and all theſe are built upon a foundation of God, and in an eternal Decree, which muſt ſtand ſure, and what would you have more?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This glory is worth the waiting for: I am not able to tell you what it is, no, nor, if an Angel ſhould come and declare it to us, are we who dwell in mortal bodies, capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it: But this we may know, that it will recompence all our Faith and Patience, all our ſorrows and ſufferings; nay, all the ſufferings of this preſent life are not worthy of the Glory that ſhall be revealed: If it did appear, and our blear eyes could now look upon it without daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it would not be ſo great as it now is, which when it ſhall appear, will tranſport us with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting admiration, that ſhall eccho back in eternal Hallelujahs.</p>

                  <p>Our Apoſtle having in the foregoing words endeavoured to ſatisfie thoſe whom he writes unto, in the reaſon why, Notwithſtanding they were ſons of God, and conſequently great heirs, their condition was at the preſent ſo obſcure, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the time of their manifeſtation was not yet come, he proceeds in the reſt of this <hi>Verſ.</hi> to encourage and ſtrengthen their Faith in the conſideration of the Glory which ſhall in due time be revealed in them: It is <hi>q. d.</hi> Have patience, and tarry but a little while, and then you ſhall look like your ſelves, and have Glory enough to declare you unſpeakabley happy.</p>
                  <p>The words before us are an aſſertion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the future happineſs of God's Adopted Children, in which we may take notice of three things that are worthy of our diligent obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.

                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Coming by ordinary means: He doth not ſay, I know it, and give you my teſtimony of it, which you may credit; but we know: you and I have the evidence of it in our ſelves, and ſuch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100127:41"/> grounds of certainty upon which we may ſafely draw this concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <q>Doct. <hi>As the future Glorious Eſtate of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God is a thing certain in it ſelf, ſo it is that whereof they may alſo have a certain and infallible Knowledge.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Though they cannot tell how well it ſhall be with them, yet that it ſhall be well, they may know: That their is a remaining Glory, and that that Glory ſhall be theirs: Not only that their is a number of the Children of Men who ſhall be bleſſed in the eternal enjoyment of God in Chriſt, but that they alſo in particular are of that number: And this indeed is a main and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of a Believers preſent inchoative hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. that now he knows, and is firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, that he ſhall be happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>Knowledge is here oppoſed Negatively, or Privatively to ignorance, diſparately to opinion. And in the clearing up of this point, we may, 1. Conſider ſomething of the nature of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in general, And then, 2. In particular e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that our future happineſs comes within the reach of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning Knowledge in general, we may obſerve, that the proper and ſuitable object
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100127:42"/> of the underſtanding is Truth, in the ſearch and contemplation whereof it is imployed, and when it is ſo imployed, it is about its own work, and Truth being a property or affection of every being that is.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>The underſtanding applyes it ſelf to the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth in the things that be: Now theſe truths are either, ſimple and ſingle, ſuch as are the ſeveral affections, inclinations, and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in things, which the underſtanding finds out and layes by themſelves, and whereby it is furniſhed for further diſcoveries: Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> elſe they are compound; when the underſtanding, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a ſubject, and having found out thoſe ſimple truths which concern it (or ſuppoſing it ſelf ſo to have done) it puts them together, and makes an Axiom, ſentence, aſſertion, or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about them. Now there are various po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in which the underſtanding may ſtand to the things; and various affections in which the things may ſtand related one to another. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not the diſtinct producing of all that here might be ſaid on this account, but only ſo far as is to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Referring to the underſtanding: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it diſcernes not the ground of the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or relation of one thing to another.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>It can declare or conclude nothing at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100127:42"/> it; and this is that which we call ignorance. Sometimes this ignorance is attended with a fond apprehenſion that he doth ſee it; miſtaking, and confidently concluding it to be that which it is not; &amp; this is properly Errour, which is bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> upon Ignorance accompanyed with an opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of knowledge. Sometimes he doth ſee or diſcern theſe differences, and is able to make a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme, or Declaration about them, and this is called Judgement; which is nothing elſe but a skill of putting ſimple Truths together, right as they ſhould be, and according to the natural and genuine relation they have each to the other ſo as to make them into a true concluſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Relating to the things themſelves: We muſt conſider that the reaſon of our compounding, or putting Truths together, is, from ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which there is, and appears to us to be between them: as when I ſee that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwen the nature of Man and Reaſon, my judgment thence compounds and concludes that Man is a reaſonable creature. Now theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions are not all alike, ſome are tyed of a ſlip knot, or are ſo connected as they may eaſily be ſeparated; ſuch is the Relation between all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent cauſes and effects, or only probable and conjectural antecedents and conſequents: as when we ſay, the diligent hand maketh rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here is ſome rational connexion between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and proſperity, but yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are ſo many
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100127:43"/> caſualties in the over-ruling Providence of God, that may check aud over-bear this, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls out that we labour in the fire for very nothing; ſow much and bring in little, and when we ſay it will be a fair day for the evening is red, though this be an ordinary ſymptom, yet it is no infallible preſage, it is oftentimes ſo, and ſometimes otherwayes: Now the judgement of theſe things is called Opinion, becauſe it is a concluſion that is drawn from reaſons which are only probable and contingent. But other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions are tyed of a faſt knot; they flow from the very nature of the things, &amp; are therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily predicated of the ſubject, and it cannot be without them: Such are all natural Cauſes and effects, as when we ſay the Sun ſhines, Man is a reaſonable Creature, &amp;c. And the judgement of theſe things is that which we call Science or Knowledge: <hi>viz.</hi> When we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and conclude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> neceſſary effects from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Cauſes, &amp; neceſſary cauſes from neceſſary effects; now ſuch as this is, is that Knowledge which a Child of God may have of his future Glory.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come to make it evident in particular that our after happineſs may be thus known and there will need but theſe two things to be cleered for the proof of it: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of beleevers depends upon neceſſary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:100127:43"/>
                  <p>And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That their ſanctified reaſon is capable of ſearching out and diſcovering the truth of theſe cauſes and ſo concluding infallibly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the happineſs of beleevers depends upon neceſſary cauſes: my meaning is, that there is ſuch a connexion between the Cauſes of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Salvation it ſelf, that they cannot fail to bring it about, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The immutable will of God purpoſing and reſolving of it: with this our Saviour encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his Diſciples, <hi>Luk. 12. 32. Fear not little flock it is your Fathers pleaſure to give you the Kingdome.</hi> The foundation of this happineſs was laid in Gods Decree; this is the Book of Life in which their Names were written; here began that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting love, which is the cauſe and fountain of all the grace afterwards revealed: this is the writing that receives no blots; this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that admits of no alterations; this is the foundation of God which ſtands ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knows who are his: Hence we have <hi>Paul</hi> bringing down of this foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge infallibly unto Glory, in that chain of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Redemption of Chriſt purchaſing and procuring of it for them: eternal Glory is one part of that purchaſe for which Jeſus Chriſt laid down that great price: and it was ſealed up to him in the Covenant of Redemption for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100127:44"/> thoſe whom he was to redeem; and this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe is made ſure and ratified, and that not only in reſpect of the purchaſe it ſelf, for which he hath payed, and of which payment he hath received a full acquittance in his reſurrection, and is actually put in poſſeſſion, being aſcended up into Heaven, and there inveſted with the tenure and poſſeſs of the Crown of Glory; but alſo in reſpect of the perſons for whom it is bought, and on whom it is to be beſtowed. Hence Chriſt, ſpeaking of the Elect, declare that it was for their ſakes that he did that work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. And profeſſeth that he had loſt none of thoſe whom his Father had given to him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>We read of purchaſed poſſeſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. And an inheritance reſerved for us in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. And of Chriſt willing that all of them ſhould be with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unalterable promiſes made to them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſaid to be heirs of the promiſe: They have great promiſes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.

                  <p n="5">5. Powerful and unfailing aſſiſtance: They are ſaid to be in God's, and in Chriſt's hand; and, as it is certain that they will not throw them out, ſo it is equally certain that no other can pluck them out: There are thoſe indeed who do attempt it, but in vain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28. God's Omnipotency is the Garriſon or guard to which they are committed, on purpoſe that they may enjoy Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 5. Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto Salvation.</hi> They are given to Chriſt and he hath commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the care and keeping of his ſpirit, and he ſeals them up to the day of Redemption, <hi>Eph,</hi> 4. 30.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100127:45"/>
                  <p>2. The Believers ſanctified reaſon is capable of ſearching ont and diſcovering the truth of theſe cauſes, and ſo to conclude infallibly. The evidence of this aſſertion will then be plain, when we have conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are ſuch effects of theſe cauſes wrought in the ſouls of all the Children of God, as are peculiar and proper to them, there is that done in and for every Child of God, which is wrought in and for no other in the world. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects are undeceiving evidences of their cauſes. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>things that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Salvation, Heb.</hi> 6. 9. There is a faith which is <hi>the faith of Gods Elect, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. There is a vocation which is linked faſt unto following glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. There is a knowledge of God in Chriſt, which is <hi>Eternai life, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. There is a ſealing of the ſpirit which confirmes everlaſting happineſs to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. There is an earneſt now given by which God confirmes the title of the Inheritance to the Souls of his People, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That theſe effects are diſcernable and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that not only by ſpecial revelation, but alſo in a rational way of arguing and inferring. If this were not a truth, then all ſuch Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precepts as put us upon this duty, of ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in reſpect of our ſpiritual eſtate, were in vain, and meerly ſuper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>luous. It is true, the law puts us upon duties impoſſible to fallen man,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100127:45"/> and this courſe God uſeth with us, to make us know our need of Chriſt: But the Goſpel puts Believers upon nothing but what may be done: Now this is made the Believers duty, in divers Goſpel-reſpects, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10. 2 Cor. 13. 5. 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 28. Nay, why ſhould the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Rules of tryal to us, if there were no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to be made by the application of them? Of what uſe is a Touch-ſtone to us, if by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, we could not be able to make diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery what Mettle is genuine, and what is deceitful?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That every Child of God is furniſhed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The effects themſelves are manifeſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable from the common Graces of Moral Men, and the counterfeit graces of hypocrites, though they may have ſome reſemblance, yet there are differencing notes, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 10.

                     </hi> I. Here we ſee one Reaſon why ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Children of God bear all the changes of the life with ſo much quietneſs and tranquillity; it lyes here, becauſe they have grounded expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of future glory. The Men of the World wonder at them; yea, ſcoff and flout, and take them for mad Men, to feed their fancyes and hopes with unſeen things, and therefore (in their opinion) the greateſt uncerteintyes. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the hopes of the Children of God were grounded in opinion, and depended upon meer contingencyes, I cannot ſee how their life ſhould not be the moſt perplexed ſorrowful and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all men; for if, after they have left all for Chriſt, it were yet a thing dubitable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould ever ſee and enjoy him in glory, they have indeed nothing left them to lean the weight of their confidence upon: But this is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100127:47"/> their felicity in the midſt of all turns, that ſtill their main intereſt in eternity is ſecured: And this indeed is the very thing which declares them to be the only happy Men: All other Men live by meer opinion, theſe only are the men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Other men know not certeinly what it is that they labour for, nor what ſhall be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of all their pains and cares; but theſe men know that their labour is not in vain, and that there will be a good end of all their troubles and pains. As to the things of this life, and with reſpect to ſubordinate ends, the Children of God labour under equal uncerteintyes with other men; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. begin: <hi>All things fall out alike to all.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 11. Time and chance happeneth to them all.</hi> They are not ſure to proſper in their Eſtates, to enjoy health, and long life, and eaſe in this World: But as to their laſt end, and the concurrent tendency of all means to it, here they have good ſecurity, and this makes them patient in tribulation, quiet under ſoreſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Thus we find <hi>Paul</hi> argues himſelf into pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and chearfulneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18, &amp; 5. 1.

                     </gap>y Arrive; if they loſe all they have in this World, yea and life it ſelf, yet becauſe they cannot loſe glory, they are not filled with conſternation: For though they cannot tell what that glory ſhal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100127:47"/> be, yet they know that it ſhall be glory, and ſuch as God himſelf ſhal give (that God who doth all things like himſelf) and they are ſatisfied that this ſhall be enough to fill you with everlaſting joyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> II. We hence learn how vain are all the attempts of the enemyes of God's Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, wherein they ſeek to make them miſerabe, or to diſcourage them in the ſervice of God. It is true, if their felicity were grounded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, the Saints enemies might have ſome probable hopes to undermine and blow them up; but thoſe that fight againſt the truth ſhall not be able to prevail. That Rock on which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Sons of God is built, lyes too deep for all the endeavours of their enemyes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine: That truth, that no Child of God ſhal ever be loſt, that no weapon that is formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſhall ever proſper, that the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World ſhall ſooner be ſhaken, the Pillars of the Earth faulter, crack, and crumble in pieces, than they fail of eternal felicity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, he that will keep a Child of God from Heaven and happineſs, muſt make void the everlaſting purpoſes of an unchangeable God, violate the eternal Covenant of Redemption, diſanul Gods firm and undeciveable promiſes, kill the immortal ſeed of grace, overcome the Omnipotent Spirit of God: Till all this can be done, the Believers well-being ſtands ſecure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:100127:48"/> which whiles Men and Devils are contriving and endeavouring, he may ſtand ſtill and ſmile at their bold and impoſſible undertakings; and whiles his hope is built, and his eye fixt upon theſe ſtrong Pillars, it is as vain for them to think to ſcare or terryfie him.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, if God ſhould hide his face, and with-draw the light of his Countenance, and leave him but a while to combate diffidence and doubting, his Spirit is eaſily overwhelmed: But if God ſtand by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give him the advantage to live in this light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his evidence is ſo good, and his knowledge ſo firmly grounded, that all which can be done againſt him, will but help to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm him. Lightly grounded opinions may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be confuted, by as probable contradictions; but firmly fixed principles, and clear evidences of Divine knowledge, are not ſhaken by the greateſt contradiction of ſinners: Such is the perſwaſion that a Child of God hath of his love to him, that he is withal fully perſwaded that all which can be done againſt it cannot diſſolve it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37, 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>And hence,</p>
                  <p>Nothing will prejudice them againſt God and his ſervice; nothing will turn them out of their way of duty and obedience to God, becauſe they are not labouring for uncerteintyes, or looking for things that may not be; they live not upon deceivable hopes, they know whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100127:48"/> they have truſted, and that he is able: to keep that which they have committed unto him to the day of the Lord; and therefore are they not weary nor faint, as thoſe that know that in due time they ſhal reap if they faint not: and though their enemyes may take away their comforts of Life, deprive them of their Eſtates, of their good name among men, of their liberty, yea of their lives too, yet, becauſe they know they cannot rob them of their glory, therefore are they reſolved in their way, and will be faithful unto death.</p>

                  <p>But to avoid controverſies, and take up with things agreed on: There are two comings of Chriſt peculiarly celebrated in the Goſpel; his coming in a ſtate of Humiliation, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of glory to Judge the World; Which latter is accordingly called his ſecond coming, <hi>Heb. 9. 28.

                  <p>As Chriſt was once ſeen here in great mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was deſpiſed, ſo he ſhal be ſeen even by his Enemies in great glory, and every knee ſhal bow to him; He ſhal come in the glory of his Father, and he ſhal come to Judge the world, <hi>Act. 17. 31. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1.

                  <p n="1">1. It is the time when Chriſt himſelf is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and it is fit that the redeemed ſhould wait for the diſcovery of their glory, till he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them cometh in his: beſides, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing depends upon his: till the World be made to know that he is both Lord and Chriſt, they cannot acknowledge that Believers in him are the Children of God and Heirs of Glory: and if Chriſt be willing to tarry till then for his manifeſtation, his People then have no reaſon to murmure, or to think the time of their clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are many Elect who are choſen to

The Day of Judgement is the fitteſt time for this: it is a day appointed for the ſetting of things to rights, to clear up all falſe Judgements and Miſtakes which there were here: it is a Day wherein the preſence of all the Creation ſhall be to look on, Heaven and Hell being for the while emptied of all their Inhabitants to come to this meeting and general Aſſembly; ſo that it will be the greateſt Glory, and moſt pompous appearance, when a Child of God on ſuch a day, and in ſuch a preſence, ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly owned and rewarded; when he ſhall be ſet to view in all his glorious ſtate, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation ſhall be audibly heard from one end of Heaven to another; ſaying, <hi>Behold a Son of God, and ſo ſhall it be done to one whom the King of glory delights to honour.</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100127:55"/> the time of their manifeſtation is not yet come: we are often ready to think in our ſelves, if we are his Children, why doth he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us ſo little to be taken notice of, and ſo much contemned? and are hence prone to judge and cenſure his Providence in this reſpect: whereas it is his Wiſdom and good pleaſure that it ſhould be ſo: Chriſt had his mean and obſcure ſtate upon Earth, and ſo muſt his followers: if we would be like him in glory, we muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him in obſcurity: God hath his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſons; Men do not as yet know God nor Chriſt, how then ſhould they know his Children? but they ſhall know him, they ſhall ſee him and be aſtoniſhed at him; and they ſhall ſee and know his People, and it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to think Gods time the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How miſerably miſtaken ſhall the Saints Perſecutors ere long find themſelves to have been, about the Children of God, whom they perſecuted? they think if they can but get the People of God under ground, if they can but ſee an end of them in this World, there is then an end for ever, and now they can triumph over them, and promiſe themſelves henceforward never to be troubled with them any more; they have their wills and hearts deſires, and are apt to boaſt over them, and ſay, where are now your great confidences, your faith, your hope? what is become of all your Prayers, and reſolute

Your Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> It is hid from the ſight of the World, and hid from their own ſence, but Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen, Faith muſt carry us as far as the great judgement, that day of Chriſts appearance, and thence we muſt gather our comforts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſupports: and there are three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unto which we ſhould exerciſe our Faith
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100127:57"/> upon this conſideration. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1, To a patient bearing of all the afflictions and troubles of the preſent time: troubles and afflictions are unwelcome Ghueſts to the mind of Man, nature is averſe to them, and if grace doth not afford ſomething to ſweeten them, they will be hard to bear: and there cannot be a greater cordial againſt theſe Faintings, then a due application of the conſideration of that happy day wherein the glory of the Children of God ſhall be made manifeſt: this hope will put life into the Soul, <hi>Rom. 8. 24. For we live by hope:</hi> the thoughts of this day were thoſe which did put courage into Chriſtians in their greateſt adverſities, and made them valiant in ſuffering for God and Chriſt, yea to contemn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thoſe ſufferings, and ſpeak of them as poor things, and ſcarce to be valued: ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> thinks of them, <hi>Rom. 8. 18.

                     </gap>ſe but find his heart quieted, and the tumults thereof appeaſed with ſuch thoughts as theſe? yea quietly to ſuffer all things for Chriſt, in theſe hopes of Glory?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To a chearful willingneſs to tarry and wait till Chriſt shall appear for the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our happineſs: be we content to live ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, and die obſcurely, and be forgotten for a while: this should ſatisfie our mind: when we are ready to think it long, to remember and conſider, that Chriſt defers our appearance no longer than he doth his own; that as ſoon as he shall appear we shall appear with him: and is it not enough that the Diſciple be as his Maſter? nay, will it not be the beſt time for us to appear with him? he is the Lord of Glory, and when he comes he brings his reward with him: and withal remember it is but a short time, yet a little while and he will come, and he will not tarry: and further ſatisfie your ſelves with this, that your Brethren muſt appear with you, even the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100127:58"/> whole number of the redeemed, ſome whereof are yet unborn, and you have reaſon to wait for them: Finally ponder, that great shews require great preparations: Chriſt is now about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he is not idle, but making all ready for his coming: and he that believeth, maketh not haſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To love his appearing, and to look for it. It is true, Chriſts appearing will be dreadful to the wicked, who are his Enemies: for he comes to judge the World in righteouſneſs; and give recompence unto every man according to his doings; hence they may well cry to the rocks to fall on them, and hills to cover them, that they may not ſee his angry countenance, nor feel the weight of his revenging hand: but to the Saints it ſhould be lovely. It is indeed a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and ſerious thing for any to think, I muſt ſtand before the dreadful Tribunal, and be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my eternal eſtate before him who is a moſt righteous Judge, who ſearcheth the heart, and cannot be deceived; where I muſt receive my final Sentence, which will be inreverſible; and if I then be found to have put a cheat upon my own Soul, I muſt periſh for ever: but to him that is a Child of God, and hath received the ſpirit of Adoption, there cannot be a more comforting thought than this: Hence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle propounds it to his <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as a great Topick, from whence to comfort one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <q>We ſhall be like him.</q>
                  <p>It follows now that we conſider the general nature of the happineſs of the Sons of God, or the diſcovery which we have of it in this life, <hi>We ſhall be like him:</hi> There is enough revealed about our future eſtate to relieve our Faith, though not to ſatisfie our curioſity: our Apoſtle would not have Believers to be diſcouraged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not a full diſcovery of what
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100127:59"/> they shall be in another World, but to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this general diſcovery which is made; and though they cannot meaſure it in all its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, yet to take up with this thought, as having plentiful conſolation in it. The Words indeed are but few, but they are full; and though our glory be shadowed to us by another, which is equally obſcure and unknown to us as our own, yet from this very darkneſs there reflects abundant Light of comfort: and be it ſo that we know nothing at all diſtinctly of the Glory which Chriſt is now poſſeſſed of, yet there is conſolation enough to be pickt out of this very conſideration, <hi>that we ſhall be like him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Words ſet forth the after ſtate of felicity which the Saints or Children of God shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto, by a ſimilitude or pattern, where we have;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The pattern it ſelf, <hi>Him,</hi> who this is, is not particularly expreſt, there being (as I formerly noted) an <hi>Ellypſis</hi> in the Words: ſome referr it to God, mentioned in the beginning of the verſe whoſe Sons we are ſaid to be, and it is proper for the Sons to be like the Father: others, and more appoſitely, apply it to Chriſt; for it is he that shall appear in glory, and <hi>Paul</hi> applies it to him in the forementioned parallel place, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. and this is certain, that the Glory to which the Man Chriſt is exalted, is the proto type of that Glory to which the Saints are appointed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 22.

                  <p>In the Explication of this Poſition. we have to conſider; 1. Wherein this likeneſs unto Chriſt conſiſts? 2. How it appears that we ſhall then be like him? 3. What ground of ſatisfaction ariſeth from hence?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wherein this likeneſs conſiſts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is an incommunicable Glory which Chriſt as God poſſeſſeth, who is God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for evermore: He is one in eſſence with his Father, He is full poſſeſſor of all the Divine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Perfections; He is the Object of

In this Glory we ought not to expect to be like him; it would be vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and higheſt Arrogancy in any of the Children of Men to feed themſelves with any ſuch expectation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Relative incommunicable Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which the humane Nature of Chriſt by vertue of perſonal union with the Son of God is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto, in conſideration of which Union the Man Chriſt is truly God, or a Divine Perſon; and in this we ſhall not be like him; there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Myſtical and Spiritual Union between Chriſt and Believers whereby they are one, he being the Political Head of the Body, the Church and ruling of it, not by Authority only, but by influence too, his Spirit being ſent forth into their hearts: But this is of a far divers nature from that Union which is between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt: The People of God are not to expect to be as nearly related unto the Son of God, as his own particular humanity is.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That our happineſs ſhall countervail and more than make us amends, for all the ſorrows and ſufferings of this life. Chriſt was a Man of ſorrows with an Emphaſis, he was put to the greateſt grief, and yet he hath a full compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all; his Exaltation holds a full proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Humiliation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, with 8, 9.

As he cannot expect to meet with-any thing better here, ſo he can hope for no better hereafter: To be with Chriſt where he is, and to be like him in the day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is as much as the Soul can deſire, and will be found a felicity ſo great, that his moſt enlarged reaching will not be able to graſp after more.</p>

Whereas the Children of God ſhal ſee him with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction. Some thinks that <hi>John</hi> argues from the cauſe, ſuppoſing that this Viſion will be a transforming Viſion, changing us into the Image or likneſs of Chriſt perfectly: others ſuppoſe him to argue from the part to the whole; the Doctrine of the Beatifical viſion being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine in the Church, as being the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity of the underſtanding.</p>

                  <p>And hence,</p>

And now (as if he had been guilty of Treaſon, and had joyned hands in ſome dangerous conſpiracy) the Prieſts, Prophets, and People, in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of fury, lay violent hands on him in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temple, and nothing can ſatisfie their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh rage but the Prophets life. The Princes, (who, though poſſibly they had but little, if any thing more of Religion then the reſt, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to more civility) enterpoſe in this fray, and call the matter to a legal hearing; which (by the over-ruling providence of God) determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his delivery out of their hands.</p>
                  <p>The Principal things obſervable in this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, are, the Peoples Accuſation, and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s Apology. The former is briefly touched in <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. in which, while they pretend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they undertake to Judge, and with a full cry pronounce him a man of death. <hi>This man is worthy to dye;</hi> or, <hi>the judgement of death is for this man,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text reads it: Which leſt they ſhould ſeem to have ſpoken of prejudice, they article againſt him for ſedition: <hi>For he hath ſpoken againſt this City:</hi> nor need witneſſes be

How happy a thing is it to preach to a pious Generation, who, becauſe they hate their ſins, love their reprovers? How unhappy to come to a People wedded to their wicked waves, who count thoſe their enemies who are ſo to their luſt? As for the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apology, I need, for the preſent occaſion, to take notice only of the juſt defence which he makes both of himſelf and his propheſie, which is contained in the <hi>Text.</hi> The Perſons before whom he makes it are the Princes, and all the

                  <p>The Vindication it ſelf conſiſts of two Parts.</p>

                  <p>The Prophets Commiſſion comprizeth the full of their Accuſation: He might have propheſied againſt other Nations without their offences; but that he doth it againſt this City, this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: He therefore aſſerts his particular charge, <hi>To propheſie againſt this Houſe and this City: Grotius</hi> indeed lenifies the expreſſion, and would have the words read, <hi>To this Houſe, and to this City:</hi> Noting that the propheſie was for them, and not againſt them: And indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p n="4">4. God ſometimes gives his ſervants a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſpecial opportunity to declare his mind againſt a ſinful Generation. Thus he did unto <hi>Jeremiah</hi> at this time, when the people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all their cityes to one of the great feaſts at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there was a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them to the Temple. And when it is thus, to omit the improving a price in our hands, is to play the fool egregiouſly.

                  <p n="5">5. There are alſo ſometimes deep and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full impreſſions upon the minds of God's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, which by an irreſiſtible impuſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to bear open and publick witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſins of the times and places which they live in. I am far from pleading for, or juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that looks like <hi>Euthuſiaſm;</hi> or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men ſhould make a ſecret <hi>impetus</hi> upon their ſpirits the rule and plea of their words and actions.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100127:92"/> to proclaim his pleaſure, directed by his word to ſpeak nothing but that is agreeing there unto; are preſt in their ſpirits to a zealous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs bearing againſt theſe and thoſe prevailing ſins and ſolemnly to denounce the Judgements of God againſt them, if men repent not. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is much of God in it, and it carrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a great evidence along with it, that God is about to do ſome ſpeedy, ſtrange work there, if he be not prevented. When we are in ſuch a frame as our Prophet was, <hi>Jer. 20. 9. His word was in my heart as a burning fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and could not ſtay.</hi> Or as <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 32. 18. <hi>I am full of matter, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within conſtraineth me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when it is thus, it concerns ſuch a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to apply theſe things to themſelves: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them not now to take exceptions and grow into a rage, but to lay them to heart. Theſe things are of God, and not in vain: They ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum a People to prepare to meet their God; and if by repentance they are not rendred heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, they will prove killing words: The ſword of his mouth will hew them in pieces, <hi>Hoſ. 6. 5. I have hewed them by my Prophets, and ſlain them by the words of my mouth.</hi> God is not wont to let ſuch words periſh, and come to nought; yea, though he may defer to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, yet he will not diſanul them: They may be deferred a while, but they ly in reſerve againſt the due time.</p>

Of what efficacy this is will appear, if we ſhall conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is the priviledge of a People in viſible Covenant with God, that there is no threatning denounced againſt them, but with a gracious reſerve and room to reverſe it in caſe of Repentance. God ſometimes indeed ſeems to ſpeak poſitively, but then, to lenefie ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute threatnings, and render them equivalent to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100127:93"/> Hypothetical, he ſpeaks after the manner of men, of repenting. God imitates his own Law, for in making of War, he firſt proffers Peace, and preſents men with termes of compliance: When he takes up armes, he would be glad if there were ſome to hold his hands: When he ſaith I will do thus, yet then he wiſheth <hi>Iſrael to prepare to meet him, Amos</hi> 4. 12. If a People of God ſuffer at his hands, it ſhall be through their own wilfulneſs. God can threaten and never execute, and yet be God unchangeable, alwayes provided his People do truely repent and amend their wayes and doings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God therefore ſends his Ambaſſadours to plead with his People about their ſins, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Judgements, that they may have motive and opportunity to repent. Divine threatnings are Expoſtulatory and awakening: They are to convince men of their ſin, and to put them in aw: They are to ſee if words will do, that blows may be ſpared. After threatnings therefore God hearkens, <hi>Jer. 8. 6. I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright.</hi> God might elſe ſtrike as well as menace; yea, it were as eaſie, nay and as merciful for him ſo to do, were it not that he had rather men ſhould live than dye.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore,</p>
                  <p>The Proclamations of War which God makes againſt a revolting People are to be annumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his long-ſuffering.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:100127:93"/>
                  <p>3. This only can put a ſtop to the wrath of God from proceeding; for, as the promiſe is full to the Penitent, ſo the threatning is as Poſitive, and as much without reſerves to thoſe that are impenitent. When a People ſay, either with their tongues or with their practices, there is no hope, but they will follow after their own cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, God alſo faith, there is no hope, but he will poure out his fury upon them. So that when God hath a purpoſe of mercy to a rebellious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and is reſolved to exalt his Grace upon them, and alſo makes known theſe purpoſes in thoſe diſcoveries which we call abſolute Promiſes, he doth it ſo as not to croſs this Rule of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with People, and therefore engageth not only to give deliverance from his Judgements; but alſo to do it in ſuch a way, as withal to give them the condition, <hi>Iſa. 57. 18. I have ſeen his wayes, and I will heal him,</hi> &amp;c. If therefore Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be (under and after much forbearance) neglected, it is both a reaſon why, and ſign that the decree, when it hath gone out its full time, ſhall certainly bring forth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God expreſſeth himſelf better pleaſed at the Repentance of his People, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of the fire of his anger, than if it had burnt up and conſumed them. He therefore gives oath that he delights not in their death, profeſſeth that he rejoyceth in their returning: like a tender Father, who is glad if any means
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100127:94"/> will reclaim his refractory, and diſobedient Son whom he loveth, and for whoſe good he longs.</p>
                  <p>Hence,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pſal. 81. 14. Oh, that my People had been obedient unto me, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my wayes.</hi> And we may truly apply that of <hi>Solomon</hi> unto Jeſus Chriſt as the Antitype, <hi>Pro. 23. 15. My Son, if thine heart be wiſe, my heart ſhall rejoyce, even mine.</hi> He reckons himſelf to have gained a greater conqueſt, when he hath won the hearts of his People to fear and ſerve him, than when he hath broken his enemies as Potters ſhreds, with the Scepter of his Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE.</hi> That I may render theſe truths practicable, and accommodate them to the uſe and benefit of this People, give me leave to deal in all plainneſs and integrity. As I would not give flattering words, leſt God ſhould deſtroy me, ſo neither would I deſignedly provoke or move any to anger, except it be at his ſins. I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſpeak words of truth and ſoberneſs; and yet chuſe rather to offend man than provoke the moſt high.</p>
                  <p>There are two Uſes I have to ſuggeſt, unto which I ſhal reduce thoſe few words which I have to ſpeak; the one by way of Conviction, the other of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Conviction: Let us ſolemnly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and rightly weigh whether or no thoſe words which have been ſpoken againſt this Place
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100127:94"/> and People on ſuch occaſions as this, were not ſuch words as God commanded thoſe that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them to come and ſpeak. I muſt confeſs, when I ſeriouſly look upon this People in their conſtitution Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, molded in the one under wholſome Laws, in the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtrict and ſacred Covenants: When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the management of theſe is under the hands of Pious and Prudent Magiſtracy, a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned Miniſtry: When I think how many there are whoſe hearts are upright with God, and do not wickedly depart from his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: When I mind that by the very confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of unprejudiced ſtrangers, here is more of ſobriety and honeſt converſation, then almoſt in any place they have occaſion to be converſant in: It ſeems hard to believe that God who is full of Mercy and Pity, who knows this frame of ours, and minds that we are but duſt, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt us, though many infirmities ſhould appear in the midſt of us: And could be willing to think that all the warnings &amp; menaces which have been uttered by theſe or thoſe, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the miſtakes of an irregular) though well minded) zeal, or the dumps and night vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome melancholick ſpirits, and thus indeed were the Prophets of old cenſured. But when I throughly weigh all circumſtances in an equal ballance, I dare not but conclude that the Lord hath ſent them to ſpeak all theſe words. What
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100127:95"/> they have ſpoken is for the moſt part upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and commended to us in Print: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are impeached for degenercy, threatned with the Judgements of God if we amend not; and thence ſolemnly adviſed and invited to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. If they underſtood the mind of God, then are we far from being ſafe and ſecure from eminent dangers. I know they have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by ſome, contemned by many more, ſcarcely believed by any, if we are to take the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of mens faith by their works. But if we ſhall ponder ſuch things as theſe, they may leave conviction behind them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were the Lords faithful Watch-men, who gave this Alarum. Not men that came u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their own heads, but were ſet up by the will of God to deſcry and give notice of his mind to his People: And theſe are ſuch as God is wont to make known his counſels to, <hi>Amos 3. 7. Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecrets to his Servants the Prophets:</hi> They were ſuch as truly feared God, and would not dare to propheſie lyes in the name of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were ſuch as loved, and laboured for the peace and proſperity of this People: Who could truly (with the Prophet) appeal to him who knows the heart, that they deſire not that woeful day: Friends, and not Enemies to our Zion, who loved and ſtood up for the way of theſe Churches, who prayed for the peace of our
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100127:95"/> 
                     <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Who mourned in ſecret for the ſins of the land, and to their ability ſtrongly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſtop the courſe of them, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the eruptions of God's Wrath: Who preached the diſpleaſure of God with pitty and compaſſion, entreating and encouraging to Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They delivered not theſe meſſages, without many heavy pangs and throes, upon their own ſpirits. This roll was bitter to them, and with a great deal of reluctancy and unwillingneſs did they declare themſelves. I my ſelf have heard ſome of them expreſſing what Combats, what Wreſtlings they have had in their own minds, how loth to ſpeak, how fearful about their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, how well they could have been content to enjoy the good-will of the People, and how greatly unwilling they were to be an occaſion of adding to the guilt of thoſe that had already run too deep on account with God: And, could they have ſo ſatisfied their own conſciences, and been clear of blood, would have altogether held their peace: Yea, ſometimes had ſaid as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Chap. 20. 9. I will not make mention of him, nor ſpeak any more in his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. There hath been great harmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in theſe Teſtimonies. It hath not been the voice only of one or two, but ſuch things have been told us from year to year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And though God may put a lying ſpirit into four hundred
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100127:96"/> falſe Prophets, yet he is not wont ſo to deceive his own ſervants. If they all are miſled, what ſhall we do? or where ſhall we ſeek for the Word of the Lord? or would not that it ſelf be a clear evidence of Gods great diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his People, if it be indeed arrived at this, that <hi>there is no Prophet, nor any one that can tell how long?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. God himſelf hath ſealed the truth of their warnings with many awful Providences: The language wherof, had there been no interpreter, hath ſpoken his anger with cleareſt demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Rod hath ſpoken as well as the Word; and every Rod hath come after ſuch ſolemn Words of warning as have been too generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in the quality of tales and falſhoods. And if God hath in part accompliſhed the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his ſervant, may we not rationally and Religiouſly Judge, that the remainder ſhall have their time of accompliſhment too, except we ſhall attend to the due means of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Grounds and Reaſons of theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are found in the midſt of us. They have not only declared the anger of an holy and jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, but alſo drawn up our indictment, and entered God's Plea againſt us, and fully anſwered all our reaſons of appeal: They have ſhewn <hi>Judah</hi> their Tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Sins; yea, ſuch ſins as according to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100127:96"/> the word of God (that rule of procedure between him and his People) are found to be incentives of Divine diſpleaſure; ſuch as raiſe up God's jealouſie, and kindle his anger againſt thoſe that are ſo found guilty of them: Nor yet have they done this of their own meer ſurmize:</p>
                  <p>But,</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We have, at leaſt verbally, acknowledged a Judgement in many, yea, the moſt, if not all which they have charged us withal: Witneſs the propoſed grounds for many days of faſting, iſſued out from thoſe who ſtand as the repreſentatives of this People: Witneſs the confeſſions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments which have been on ſuch dayes made unto God: And that which will ſtand up for a full clearing of this truth againſt us, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Records of the laſt Synod, in which we ſhall find the full and free conſent of the Elders and Meſſengers of theſe Churches, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the hand of God is out againſt this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple awful in tokens of wrath; and giving him the Glory, by confeſſing that there are theſe and thoſe ſins, not only fallen into through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, but ſo prevalent in the midſt of us, as to acquit, not only a juſt, but a merciful God too in all his ſeverities againſt us. And ſhall we not yet believe? Or ſhall we ſay to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Lord ſent thee not, but <hi>Baruch</hi> ſtirreth thee up? Shall we ſay, we have ſuch a Magiſtracy, ſuch a Miniſtry, ſuch Churches, and therefore
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100127:97"/> what need we to fear? When did <hi>Micah</hi> ſay, Zion <hi>ſhall be ploughed as a field?</hi> Was it not in the dayes of good <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> When did God ſay <hi>I will remove</hi> Judah <hi>out of my ſight?</hi> Or when did <hi>Zephaniah</hi> deliver his terrible propheſies, but in the dayes of godly <hi>Joſiah?</hi> All I ſhall here add is thus much: If God's faithful Meſſengers are to be believed when ſpeaking from God himſelf; if the Word of God be to be credited which they have delivered to us; if the concurrence of ſo many (divers of whom are now with God) be of any weight,; if Providence may be thought to ſpeak any thing, and the Rod have a voice in it; if to be ſelf-Judged and Condemned be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny efficacy; then there is an hand-writing of God given out againſt us; and therefore let it be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Exhortation: Be we perſwaded to make it our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſerious endeavour, by an univerſal and through Repentance to ſeek a way to eſcape the after effects of God's diſpleaſure. Let us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the voice of the Lord our God; let us amend, and God will repent.</p>
                  <p>I might urge many things ſtrongly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative to preſs the great neceſſity of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let it ſuffice to give ſome brief hints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Remember your Profeſſion to the World. How oft have you given it out that your deſign, and main buſineſs here is to promote the ſervice of Chriſt, and maintain the intereſt of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100127:97"/> Which is then only upheld when a People ſtick cloſe to the Law and to the Teſtimony, walking by the holy Rules of Scripture, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the revealed will of God in his Word, and can only be your Glory among the Nations, and will be ſo if you thus do, otherwiſe your very profeſſion will be your ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Remember your Covenants, and ſolemn Engagements to be the Lords. How you have called God to witneſs, and bound your ſelves in an oath and a curſe to ſerve God, and him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: How you have avouched him to be your Lord and Law-giver, and renounced the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of your own wills and luſts.

                  <p n="3">3. Forget not your own Confeſſion. How oft have ye made large and full declarations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelves?

                  <p n="4">4. Think how many Calls you have had to Repentance. The mercies of God to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and continued to our ſelves; by theſe God expoſtulates, <hi>Jer. 2. 5.

And yet I am afraid there is more to do, and ſome ſevere tryals to befal us in order to this: For God will do for his People in wayes ſuitable to his own ends, and ſuch which ſhall recommend him to be a God glorious in Holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Know it, there yet wants ſuch a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as God requires; and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he hath ſaid or done. Though he hath convinced us, counſelled us, warned, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſmitten, renewed his Judgements with breach upon breach, altered his courſe, tryed us in one fire, and after in another, the old ſcent yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: This may be the burden of the Song, and make up the period of every plea, <hi>yet have ye not returned to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our perſent condition and exigencies call for ſpeedy Repentance. It will be our wiſdom and can alone be our ſafety,: Men are againſt us, and that which is moſt awful, to conſider, is, God ſeems to be againſt us too. Providences look to an eye of reaſon, as if they were conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring a further day of trouble upon us. On all the Glory, whereon there was ſometimes a defence, there now appears to be a blaſt. We are brought low in our outward affairs, and low
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100127:99"/> in ſpirirual things, and ſome ſudden and dolef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But if we may recover Gods gracious preſence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage his protection, all ſhall be well: Yet if not now done, a few dayes may ſumme up and cancel our felicity, and we be left to ſigh out our Ichabod.</p>
                  <p>I ſhal not need to be prolix in the directive part of this uſe, ſince divers that have gone before me, have largely unfolded our particular eſtate, and preſcribed rules for our recovery: Both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us what there is of ſin prevailing, and wherein we may ſo teſtifie our Repentance as to obtain a repeal of that ſentence which hath been paſt againſt us. Yet if I could help to drive home any of theſe nails, I ſhould think it labour not in vain. I need but ſay, if you will believe the Meſſengers of Chriſt; nay, if you will but believe your ſelves and your own confeſſions, there is work enough cut out for your reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Do but amend cordially what you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be amiſs, and I dare affirm that God will accept it, I ſhall not ſo far treſpaſs on the time, and other occaſions as to urge every particular: It may ſuffice to hint at ſome things which ſeem eſpecially to call for our ſpeedy and extraordinary endeavours, and theſe do more immediately concern.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The body of this People conſidered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with liberties, and engaged as one man
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100127:99"/> for the upholding of them in wayes according to God. Let me tell you that <hi>for the Diviſion of</hi> Reuben <hi>there are great ſearching of heart.</hi> Theſe jealouſies and ſuſpitions one to another, thoſe minings and counterminings that are among you, thoſe aſperſions and defamations which you caſt one upon another, and upon your beſt friends, thoſe endeavours to ſtrengthen a party, and countermand your brethren, are provoking to God, and like to prove ruinating to your ſelves. It is not a ſin only, but a Judgement too, and that which tends to iſſue in miſery, <hi>Hoſ. 10. 2. Their heart is divided, now ſhall they be found guilty.</hi> Gal. 5. 15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi> Your ſecurity is in being one for God: your ſafety is only in unity. There are enough abroad who watch for your halting, you need not your ſelves lay open one anothers infirmities: And one would think it might ſufficiently awaken you to think how little Gods work goes forward, or his Glory ſtrenuouſly promoted, whiles men ſpend their little zeal in oppoſitions and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives one againſt another, as if herein lay the life of Religion. This picks out the cement, and crumbleth away the mortar, which is the ſtrength of the building, and when gone, with what eaſe may it be made to fall? To remedy this, put on charity. When God's People agree in the end, though for a while they may not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100127:100"/> Judge alike of the means to it in ſome critical points and circumſtance, it is far from a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit ſo to abound in our own ſenſe, as to proclaim or declare ſuch enemies to the cauſe of God, that ſpeak not in every punctilio with us. Men of the largeſt charity here, are the beſt friends to this Cauſe. It is Gods will and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that his People ſhould in many things beat out their way by debates: But men that may not be thwarted in their own private ſentiments, are dangerous Coals, fitted to kindle a deſtroying fire among us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe Churches as tyed up in the ſtricteſt bonds of Covenant to be the Lords: Whoſe great receding from, and manifold notorious breaches of this Covenant of God, do ſtrongly call for, and vehemently urge, ſolemn and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous renewals of it before him. Eſſayes towards this, I confeſs, have been made by ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But what damps and demurs are caſt on the work by the many that hold back, is matter of lamentation: And truly the reaſon rendred by many makes it ſtill the more lamentable, <hi>viz.</hi> Left it ſhould encreaſe the guilt of the Churches through neglect of performance. If indeed it be come to that, that we are reſolved to mend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then Covenants of Reformation will prove dangerous things: But may we not upon the ſome plea raze out our old Covenant, caſt off our Religion, reſolve to be under no engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100127:100"/> to God at all, and ſay to him, <hi>We are Lords, and will come no more unto thee?</hi> All I will here urge is this; if theſe Churches are not prepared to renew their Covenant with God, they are not prepared for mercy: If the way of our Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie be more dangerous than our ſtate of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, our danger is tremendous: If all confeſs that ſpiritual ſlumber, luke-warmneſs, earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs, ſlighting of Ordinances, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of the Meſſengers of Chriſt, carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the World, and many the like evils are crept into, and prevail much over our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the Covenant-People of God are not capable of a reſolute, ſtrenuous, and voluntary engagement to the rooting of theſe out, our wound is next to incurable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To the repreſentative body of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled in General-Court; on whom it lyes as an indiſpenſible duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the maintainance of God's Glory, and to put forth utmoſt care for the ſecuring of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the true Religion, and extirpation of that which is falſe. The prevalency of corrupt Doctrines, and impudent boldneſs of many in proſecution of them, calls for your vigilant and reſolute induſtry in the ſuppreſſion thereof. I am not ignorant to how much calumny I expoſe my ſelf in mentioning this point; but it is in Gods cauſe which I may not decline for fear of reproach. I have often heard (though, I muſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100127:101"/> needs confeſs, not without ſome ſecret regrets) the Encomiaſtick titles put upon this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if it were ſingularly a Theocraſy, and carried in it a glorious ſpecimen of the Kingly Government of Chriſt: But I fear, if this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment decline, or think it not their concern vigorouſly to extend their power in upholding the duties of the firſt Table, and ſecure them from the invaſion of perverſe men, theſe will be found no more than a few empty Hyperbolies. I confeſs, your legiſlative power is limited, and muſt take its meaſure from your Charter; nor do I adviſe to exceed that which God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath inveſted you withal. I believe it ſhal never be charged as a ſin upon you, that you did (with grief of heart) bear with thoſe things which you could not regularly confront. But if men, upon pretence of Conſcience (and who will not pretend it, if they may find it a ſhelter againſt Juſtice,?) If thus, I ſay, they may be ſuffered (though it be in your hand to oppoſe them) without any reſtraint to run to and fro. Diſſeminate their erronious principles, make breaches in Churches, undermine and ſeduce ſilly ſouls, ſet up their Poſts by God's Poſts, enjoy as free and publick liberty to carry on their own wayes, as thoſe Churches of Chriſt whom you profeſs to countenance and defend, and that by a total ſilence, and a full connivance; if thus you can tolerate the diſhonour of Chriſt, let me
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100127:101"/> boldly ſay, I believe he will ſoon and ſignally teſtifie his diſlike of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To the Honoured Magiſtrates, and all ſuch as have an Executive power in their hands. It is an obſervation of one, that nothing is more dangerous and diſgraceful than to ſuffer Laws to ly by unprofitable, for want of Execution. the beſt Laws, if only promulgated and not purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will not promote a Reformation. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are of the mind, that it is good to have Laws as a Teſtimony of your diſlike of ſuch &amp; ſuch practices though never proſecuted againſt the breakers of them: But, beſides that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aw with impunity, will naturally embolden to a like violation of others, under the ſame preſumption; ſuch Laws will indeed be a witneſs, not for, but againſt a People, that they thought, and were in conſcience perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was their duty, but had not courage or zeal enough to put it in execution. There are many ſins, ſome very crying; profane and ſcandalous Sabbath breaking, beaſtly drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deſperate curſing and ſwearing, woeful and miſerable idleneſs: There are good and wholſome Laws againſt thoſe ſins, let there be ſuch a check and reſtraint laid upon them, that our ſtreets may not be witneſs of them: If theſe do prevail, God hath ſaid that the Land ſhall mourn for them: Great induſtry and zeal is needful here when ſin is grown impudent; the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100127:102"/> exerting of it will be your honour, and by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, you ſhall verifie the title God hath dignified you withal, that you are Shields of the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To the Reverend Elders, the Meſſengers of Chriſt, that you be faithful to God, to this People, and to your own Souls: in particular much to ſtudy and preach the ſins of the times and places you live in. God hath placed us as Watch-men to deſcry danger, and give due war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of approaching evil. Let us be faithful in our places, vigilant in our work, much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, ſeeking to find out the mind of God, and not afraid with boldneſs to declare it though the times may ſeem hardly to reſent us. We have an account to give for Souls and God will demand of us what is become of thoſe who were committed to our charge. Above all let us take care to do as we ſay, and be enſamples to the Flocks: It may be, by this means you ſhal not only ſave your ſelves, but alſo thoſe that hear you. Beware of being Idol-Shepherds; they are evil times we live in, men love to be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and encouraged in ſin, but let us have no fellowſhip with their works of darkneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprove them. In all your dealings with men be plain and faithful: Some may for that ſay with <hi>Ahab, Art thou he that troubleth</hi> Iſrael? But be not angry but compaſſionate, and mourn in ſecret for them. Let us ſtudy to be men of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100127:102"/> knowledge, fixed in principles, holy in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, in a word, let us do all we can (more than we do) if it be poſſible, to ſave a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the wrath of God, and impending Calamities: Let us be ſtill more plain, more particular, more ſerious in this great work.</p>
                  <p>To haſten towards a Concluſion, I ſhall ſtrike but one blow more on theſe nails, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten them, and ſo recommend all unto him who is the great Maſter of the Aſſemblies. It is an opinion which ſome ſeem ſtrongly to be built upon, and it renders them ſtrangely preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>viz.</hi> That the foundations of this People are unmovable; that our civil conſtitutions, and Church Covenants have ſo engaged the preſence of God with us, that we ly out of the reach of forraign miſchief. Thus the <hi>Athenians</hi> once chained down the Image of <hi>Minerva,</hi> their Tutelary Goddeſs, to her ſtation, and ſo thought they had ſecured themſelves from all dangers of being ſubjugated by any enemy, or oppreſſed with any evil. And to think to oblige the true God with verbal Covenants, and formal profeſſion, is no other than to make him an Idol: Yet thus the cry of many ſpeaks in the language of thoſe <hi>Jews, Jer. 7. 4. The Temple of the Lord are theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Forgetting how many wayes they have diſoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and giving God juſt reaſon to be aſhamed to own or acknowledge them. How fond ſuch thoughts as theſe are, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uinous heaps of many
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100127:103"/> renowned places, which once enjoyed as much of Gods preſence with them as any in the World, do ſtand for monumental witneſſes, The more of God hath ſometimes been among you, the greater is your ſin, and the ſpeedier may be your Calamity, If growing weary of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you abuſe all your liberties to deſperate li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. There is nothing ſo dear or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto God, or ſticks ſo cloſe and near unto him, but if it once comes to interfear with his Glory (which is his beloved end, and he will upon no pretence part withal) he can remove it far enough from him. See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 24, 25. You have here the only remedy to recover a ſick and dying People,; this will, nothing elſe will affect it. True Repentance, and through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation never come in vain, though when Judgement was gathered into a thick Cloud and ready, yea, beginning to drop down in a ſtorm of fury, but it hath blown it over. This God proffered <hi>Judah</hi> here when they were almoſt ripe for ruine; and this God once again this day proffers to you. Oh, be not proud and ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked! be not obſtinate and rebellious! Why will you dye? Obey the voice of the Lord, do what he bids, do what your Conſciences ſay you ought to do, do what you have before God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed your ſelves guilty for, becauſe you have neglected to do it: Do what all reaſon and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires, and for the omiſſion whereof you
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100127:103"/> have no juſt ground or pretence; do this and live. <hi>Be willing and obedient, and you ſhall eat the fruit of the Land.</hi> Be grieved for Sin and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and it will grieve God to put you to grief. But if all that is ſaid from time to time, be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; if theſe counſels prove as water ſpilt upon a rock; and though you can lend an ear to hear theſe words with patience, yet will not do them, but can ſlightly caſt them out of your minds, and throw them behind your backs; they will ſtand on record againſt you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a farther aggravation of your guilt: And in that day when all thoſe things ſhall come to paſs, of which you have been ſo frequently and ſolemnly warned, and the Lord ſhall ſuffer none of the the words of his Servants to fall to the ground. Then ſhall you know there have been Prophets among you.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. That there alwayes have been, and ſtill are thoſe in the World, who are deſignedly ſet againſt the Lord. There are ſuch deſperate and fool-hardy ones, that bend all their wits and power againſt the God of heaven. And if any ſhould enquire, who theſe <hi>Nimrods</hi> be? Or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100127:107"/> where theſe Gyants dwell? I anſwer in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, every wicked man is he that ſo doth: It is part of his deſcription given, <hi>Job 15. 25, 26.

So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 3. with 5. <hi>They have taken crafty counſel againſt thy Peo-People:—They are confederate againſt thee.</hi> They may poſſibly in words confeſs God and Chriſt; yea, and be ſo fooliſh as to think they do God the beſt ſervice, when they do the moſt againſt his ſervants: But ſtill God takes them for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That the Ring-leaders and principal Agents among God's enemies, are men of the greateſt natural wit and underſtanding: So that if events were to be judged of according to the quality of inſtruments they would be thought moſt likely to ſpeed. If there be a plot laid againſt Gods <hi>Davids,</hi> you ſhall hear that the Worlds <hi>Achitophels</hi> (thoſe Oracles of Policy) are in it. The Devil, if at any time he finds any that are ſingularly witty, uſeth with moſt endeavours to make them notoriouſly wicked, and ſeeks to fill their hearts with deepeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100127:108"/> againſt the wayes and People of God: He uſeth more than ordinary care, to make ſuch men his own. That obſervation of our Saviours is too obſervable to be queſtioned, <hi>Luk. 26. 8. The Children of this World are in their generation wiſer than the Children of light.</hi> The Apoſtle, when he would Charactarize thoſe that ſtand on Gods ſide, and thoſe that take part with his enemies, puts the greateſt number of the wiſe and prudent of the World on the adverſe part, and finds a very few ſtanding on God's ſide, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26. Not many wiſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. That the enemies of God and his People do make it their buſineſs, to conſult and contrive, how they may manage their cauſe to the beſt advantage againſt them. It<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a plot which is ever on foot, and unto which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution is continually made: For this they ride and run, and communicate their counſels: Such is their wrath and malice that they cannot ly ſtill: This is the very piece they have on the Anvil, and upon which they are alwayes beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is the Maſter-plot in the World, <hi>David</hi> deſcribes their ſedulity in this buſineſs, <hi>Pſal. 64. 5, 6. They commune of laying ſnares privily, they ſearch out iniquitie, they accompliſh a diligent ſearch.</hi> They ſtrein their inventions, turn every ſtone, dig deep to lay their counſels ſecret, and bring about their purpoſes unexpectedly: Hence, they are ſaid to go in travail with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. That this conſpiracy hath a great many friends, favourers, and confederates. It hath the greateſt ſtrength of men on its ſide, and is daily growing and encreaſing, <hi>Pſal. 3. 1. How are they encreaſed that trouble me?</hi> It may be ſaid of this, as of that of <hi>Abſalom, 2 Sam. 15. 12. The conſpiracy was ſtrong, for the People encreaſed continually with</hi> Abſalom. The great men of the World are wont for the moſt part to engage in it, <hi>Pſal. 2. 2. The Kings of the earth ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together.</hi> And the little ones are apt in greateſt number to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their leaders, eſpecially in that which is evil, to which they are drawn by a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity: yea, this malignity ſpreads ſo far as to draw many People, and joyn hearts and counſels and confederacies in it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 5, to 8. <hi>The Tabernacle of</hi> Edom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The army of the Saints are but a little flock, their enemies fill the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: What theſe politick heads contrive, they have a multitude of hands ready preſt to put in execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 5. The enemies of God are very preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, and full of confidence that the day ſhall be their own; they make no doubt of bringing about their devices againſt God and his Church. Such is their bold confidence that they can even make a triumph before the Victory, and look upon the oppoſite cauſe as gone before ever
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100127:109"/> they ſtrike a ſtroke, <hi>Pſal. 10. 6--11. He hath ſaid in his heart, I ſhall not be moved; God hath forgotten.</hi> And 64. 4. <hi>They encourage themſelves in all evil matter, 71. 11. ſaying, God hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him: Perſecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him.</hi> See with what a confident boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Senacherib</hi> ſends his defiance againſt God, <hi>Iſa. 37. 10, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 5. 2. As if Heaven were not able to confront them: They ſay that Wiſdom, and Counſel, and Strength are all on their ſide, and who then ſhall think to defeat them of ſucceſs? Thus they boaſt before they put off the Harneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. God many times ſuffers his enemies to be ſeemingly proſperous and ſucceſſeful in their undertakings againſt him. Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath holy ends, for which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Church is oftimes brought very low, whiles God ſeems to ſtand by and not regard, ſo that his People are ready to think that Providence ſleeps; and God appears as if he had withdrawn and eſtranged himſelf from his own intereſt.</p>

                  <p>Never more need of Faith for the upholding of the ſpirits of the People of God, againſt the thence ariſing Temptations; and no better help than the Doctrine that is before us: And the things we are hence to learn are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to be much moved when we ſee or hear what is contriving &amp; practicing againſt God in the World. It is ſaid, <hi>Iſa. 7. 2. It was told the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>ſaying,</hi> Syria <hi>is confederate with</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and his heart was moved, and the heart of his People, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</hi> Let it not be ſo with them that fear God. It is now a time to pray hard and believe much, but it is no time to perplex and diſtract our ſelves. We may interpret thoſe words as ſpoken to the Church in way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <hi>Pſal. 64. 10. Be ſtill, and know that I am God.</hi> What are you afraid of? It is againſt God all that is undertaken; and whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſiſted him and proſpered? do you think that Men or Devils ſhall ever drive God out of the field, and make a triumph upon <hi>the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Be quiet, let God alone, he will do his own work, and that to purpoſe: Tarry a little
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100127:118"/> and you ſhall ſee theſe Bravo's weltering in their own gore, and the arrows of the Almighty drunk with their blood. It ſhall not be long ere the field be cleared, and not an enemy ſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Yet a little while and the wicked ſhall be no more, Pſal.</hi> 37. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to be put by our profeſſion and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice of God by all the menaces of the World againſt us. Let Godly men hold on their way, though the wicked be laying ſnares in it. It is a ſin, and a diſgrace for a Child of God to ſtand ſtill, or ſtart aſide, though utmoſt perils ſeem to threaten him. <hi>Luther</hi> being called to <hi>Worms,</hi> for the defence of the truth, was diſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome friends, who adviſed him that there was a plot laid againſt his life: but with an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical reſolution he profeſſed, that though all the Tiles of their houſes were Devils, yet go he would. Rightly regulated and well tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red zeal is very neceſſary in times when Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſtricken at on all ſides. 'Tis the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and honour of a good Chriſtian to hold faſt his own, and preſs forward againſt oppoſition; yea, by an holy Antiperiſtaſis, to gather ſtrength and courage from that which is intended to make him faint, <hi>Job 17. 9. The Righteous alſo ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not to be diſcouraged though for a while the wickeds counſels ſeem to take place.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100127:119"/> It is the Pſalmiſts advice, <hi>Pſal. 37. 7. Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way, becauſe of the man who bringeth wicked devices to paſs.</hi> When you hear how Gods cauſe is the preſent ſuffering cauſe, and ſeems to go down the wind; ſo many Churches of Proteſtants diſſipated in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſo many thouſands ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring their Religion in <hi>France:</hi> So much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in one place, ſo much power of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in another, be not now diſ-ſpirited: The Seas roar, and the waves thereof make a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous noiſe, mountains come rolling down into the midſt of the Seas; ſtill there is a River to make glad the City of God: <hi>God ſits upon the water-floods, God ſits King for ever.</hi>

                     </gap> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is concerned in all this, and he will not give it away: God is not aſleep, though you are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think him ſo: He hath holy ends why he ſuffers all this, and will make a diſcovery of them ſeaſonably: The pit is all this while digg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, the ſword is whetting, the arrows are preparing for the Perſecutours; the Scene ſhall be turned, and a tragical end waits upon them: For, <hi>though hand joyn in hand, yet ſhall not the wicked go unpuniſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Wait with patience and holy confidence under the outmoſt extremities, till God's time comes to blaſt all the counſels of his adverſaries, and utterly diſſolve hells conclave. Though God be not come as yet viſibly, yet believe that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:100127:119"/> will come ſeaſonably, and there are theſe two things that may fortifie your confidence in this belief, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That all their Counſels as yet have not prevailed, and the reaſon only is taken from God's Power and Providence. It is ſaid that <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> have carried on a plot, ever ſince the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> to blow up the Proteſtant intereſt there; and this is a ground of comfort, that although God hath not as yet (for holy ends) wholly ſcattered it, yet he hath wonderfully diſappointed it. That Veſſel, the Church, hath had many a bluſtring ſtorm raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, but it is not as yet foundred at all, but weathers it out againſt Tempeſts,; and this is certain, that he who hath delivered, can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and will deliver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God's counſel ſtands Diametrically oppoſite to the counſel of wicked men: <hi>i. e.</hi> as to the order and deſign they are carrying one. They conſult his diſhonour and his Churches diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance: He is mean while conſulting his own Glory, and his Peoples ſafety: Let God then alone to daſh theirs, and eſtabliſh his own, hear what he ſaith for this, <hi>Iſa. 14. 24, 25, 26, 27. The Lord of hoſts hath ſworn, ſaying, Surely as I have thought, ſo it ſhall come to paſs, and as I have purpoſed, ſo ſhall it ſtand,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>This is the purpoſe that is purpoſed uopn the whole Earth,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath purpoſed and who ſhall diſanul it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100127:120"/> Men ſay it ſhall be thus, but God ſaith it ſhall be ſo, whoſe word ſhall ſtand, theirs or his? When you read bloody decrees, the product of humane conſultations, then read the book of God, &amp; oppoſe to them the gracious decrees of Heaven. It was <hi>Luther</hi>'s conſolation to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> in a time of great danger; <hi>Let your Highneſs know (ſaith he) and nothing doubt, but that this buſineſs is otherwiſe concluded of in Heaven, than it is at</hi> Norinberge: Where the Emperour and States were met in Counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God knows what his own thoughts are towards his People, even thoughts of peace, whatever the thoughts of men may be, <hi>Jer</hi> 29. 10. Wait then, the wickeds day is a coming; in due time their foot ſhall ſlide: The Web which they have been for a long while in weaving, God will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel in a moment: He will ſhortly muſter up his Forces and draw out his Armies into the Field, and call together the Fowls of Heaven to his great Supper which he ſhall provide for them, where he will give them to eat of <hi>the fleſh of Kings, and the fleſh of Captains, and the fleſh of mighty Men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 17. 18. This is the work which he hath undertaken to do, and will certainly accompliſh it throughly, who hath written on his Veſture, and on his Thigh, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. And ſince the caſe ſtands thus, what is there then remaining more for us to do, but to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100127:120"/> be the Lord's Remembrancers. Not ceaſing day nor night to be earneſtly and importunately put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in mind of his Covenant, his Name, and Glory? and in Faith pray to him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his poor, deſpiſed, and abuſed Church, which is as a Lilly among the Thornes, that he would remember and not forget, or grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of the Congregation which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of old, and ariſe to ſave thoſe that are as ſheep prepared to the ſlaughter, and appointed to dy: And when we have thus done, and in a way of ſo doing, there is nothing more but to ſit ſtill and wait to ſee the Salvation of the Lord.</p>
